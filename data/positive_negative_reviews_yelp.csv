Great fruit and vegetables. Bulk items like nuts and cranberries are a good value. Check out the meat and deli. Cage free chicken and grass fed beef. Salmon and Tuna are fresh. They do have some good values here. The cashiers are good and give the nickel bag discount.|1
"As far as indie record stores, this is truly as good as it gets in the valley. It is a breath of fresh air because it is a REAL record store, and you can sample CD's along the wall to get your music fix. I love how they have a list of recommended new releases. I definitely refer to them if my music is getting stale. Recently, my husband and I have bought albums from Beirut, Andrew Bird and Iron & Wine. They have everything your heart desires- so go and get you some!  OH- and I just found out you can buy concert tickets there, and they usually give out a free ""Magnet"" magazine with each purchase. Woohoo!"|1
"A prospective customer at Sakana must check out the Customer Appreciation Sushi Roll menu before ordering from the ""main"" menu. Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better.  $7 for 5 large cuts of Hamachi sashimi. Add $2 for a bowl of sushi rice and you will be in sashimi heaven. The Ikura at this restaurant are the best I have ever tasted anywhere.  Beers for as afforadable as $3.25. Sodas with free refills for $1.95.  Can you find this quality at these prices in Scottsdale? I didn't think so!"|1
great pho , boba :) and vermicelli .. awesome !|1
We came here for lunch and were a little leery when we first walked in. I had the cream of leek soup, my mother had the sausage salad, and my aunt had the Greek salad and we were all very impressed. We took a bangers and mash pasty to go, but we are so full, that it'll be awhile before we can try it. The service was a little slow, but the quality of food and atmosphere made up for the inconvenience.|1
Love this place...can't beat it for a healthy meal. Tons of good options that are tasty without all the cheese.|1
"*CASH AND CHECKS ONLY* *OPEN 9 AM, 7 DAYS A WEEK*  Love this place. Took my daughter here a year ago to get her very FIRST haircut. We had Miss Tara, who provided us with a ""first haircut"" certificate and she also had these tiny quarter-size ziploc bags for my daughter's very first strand of hair that she cut. The haircut was $15. Along with the haircut, Miss Tara styled it and put clips and glitter in her hair. My daughter LOVED it.   The place itself was kid-friendly. There's a little kitchen for the kids to play with while waiting for their haircut. There are 3 big kid chairs for older kids to get their haircut. And there are 2 car-styled chairs for the younger kids.   I took my daughter for her SECOND haircut today. We had Miss Annette. She was great. Again, my daughter got her hair styled after her haircut and got glitter and flowers put into her hair. The haircut was $15. We also got a punchcard, where you're 9th haircut will be free.   This place does walk-ins, but it is better to call and schedule an appointment since they don't have a specific opening/closing time. They take CASH ONLY so keep that in mind."|1
This is the best record store in Tempe, hands down.  Second best in the Valley (after Tracks in Wax).    I have been collecting records for almost 30 years now, and have been going to Eastside for about half that time - at least since I could conveniently drive out to the east valley, and regularly since I moved to this end of town about 10 years ago.  I remember the fish tank with the moray eel and the fact that the plaza they are in used to let them have twice the space.  It amazes me that they have survived all this time.  And, boy, am I glad they have.  A good chunk of my collection, and even my current turntable, has come from here.    If I ever won the lottery, I would probably spend enough money in one day here to keep the place in business for another few decades.  Heck, I'd even buy them a bigger place if I could!  This is one of the last truly independent record stores.  I'm happy to support them, and I hope everyone else will continue to do so as well.  Edit: They closed down on 12/31/10.  I'm going to miss them.  Hopefully they'll reopen somewhere else, even if it is only online.  My regret is that I didn't have enough money to do one final run through there.|1
A great little spot to find! Fresh, Fresh, Fresh Sushi and great eats! Be sure to try the green bean appetizer!|1
I've searched the world for the perfect pepperoni pizza.  I've searched it over and over again.  Damn it man!  I've wasted my life searching and searching to the farthest corners of the earth to find that saucy cheesy meaty delite!  Only to find that my favorite pepperoni pizza will always be Barro's,  a restaurant just around the corner from where I grew up.    I loathe you, you tasty cheesy bastards...oh, and can I have a large pepperoni to go?|1
My husband and I have eaten Chinese food all over Phoenix, and hands down, Big Wa has been the best.  The BBQ pork with fresh spicy mustard is A-Mazing!!  We have ordered about 6 different dishes from here, sometimes totally blind and the food is always great!|1
Dr. Koch and his staff are wonderful! I know that I am in great hands and being given the best care possible. They do a great job at working you in to the schedule if you have a last minute pain that needs some extra attention. I would highly reccomend Arizona Chiropractic to anyone!?|1
This is by far the best farmer's market I've been to in the Valley.  Still small by comparison to LA and the Bay Area but is off to a great start with lots of potential and space to grow into.  McClendon has a great spread of high quality mainly organic produce and is constantly restocking so it's ok if you don't get there first thing.  It was exciting to see beautiful Tuscan kale and broccoli rabe at prices lower than Sprouts.  Meyer lemons and blood oranges were also available.  Phoenician's outstanding loaves were only $3. You're welcome to sample - we particularly liked the Olive Walnut and Dark Chocolate Cherry.  We enjoyed Digestif's Frittata ($4) made with thin layers of potato, eggs, pork belly and spinach.  Other combinations available were Dandelion with Goat Cheese and Mushrooms with Garlic Confit. Executive Chef Payton Curry is also there to demonstrate pulling fresh mozzarella which is served with a variety of sauces and toppings,  It was fun walking around this bustling market sampling food, like tamales, which we intend to come back for next week.  If I can get myself out of bed at a decent hour on Sat, I'll be here for sure every week until the season ends in May.|1
"EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!   Even with Happy Hour in full swing and the place full of parched Winkies, the service at our large table was spot on. We barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced H20 was before us, our drink orders were taken . . . and one quick blink of the eye and the ""peacemakers"" were before us!    Now that's what I call HAPPY HOUR!  Bravo Thirsty Lion!"|1
We are picky about food because we try to eat healthy. Owner and server were very accommodating and courteous. They took time to understand what we want and delivered on it. One gripe, we had difficulty finding it because neon sign was not working. We had a great experience.|1
"So my coworkers and I decide we want donuts on a Weds. I know typically donuts are on Fridays but what the hay. In my search for a really good donut I go to the Internet and Google ""best donuts"" and low and behold Bosa Donuts comes up. They have 3 locations, and the one in Chandler has 12 reviews, which all raved about how great Bosa Donuts were. So I notice they have a location at 35th Ave and Glendale! I had seen it many times but never stopped in thinking it was just the average run of the mill donut shop. Boy was I wrong!  Bosa Donuts is by far the best donut I have had in a very long time, maybe ever! I stopped by for a dozen this morning and bought a little something special for myself. I got to the car and took one bite and was in heaven. The what I would call a Cinnamon Fry with crumb topping was to die for. What I liked the most was it was not greasy like some other donut shops. (I won't mention any names, you know who you are!) Lightly crisp on the outside and so tender on the inside. The crumb topping was just the icing on the cake. It was all I could do not stop and get some milk so I could utterly devour the rest of my donut on the way to work. I did have a bite of an Apple Fitter after getting to work and it was very yummy too. They have many varieties and some wonderfully looking croissants too. If you have not tried Bosa Donuts in Phoenix you are missing out!"|1
What a brewpub should be.  The beers are great. The food, the Slingers (wow) & the service is all top rate.  Lisa, the server was very helpfull. I need say no more.|1
I've been here a couple of times.  The first time was on first fridays.  I expected it to be packed, but I was able to walk right in and be seated.  They had a table reserved and they must not have shown, so we lucked out.  I got the Sante Fe, a roast beef panini, and it was great.  They had some good beers on tap too.  Its a cool little funky place to grab a good sandwhich.  The second time I came here it was after a concert.  There was some horrible band playing that I wish would have shut up so I could hear the people in front of me without having to feel sharp pains in my ear, but the meal was still good and I liked it.  Any place that is open late close to downtown is perfect, especially since the kitchen doesn't close until 12:30|1
"I came to Timo for my birthday last week after hearing rave reviews about it from a few friends of mine. I met up with the fabulous Jennifer T. and I was so happy to check this place out!  I like any place that I get to walk in through a back door. I passed through the very chill looking patio area first, another plus in my book. Plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off. Inside was intimate, but with the large windows, it wasn't dark and depressing. Like your own little happy wine bar world.  They have an amazing wood burning oven. Normally, that itself is plenty good enough, but then there's the food that comes out of that wonderful oven. I only tried the spinach and artichoke dip, which was the best I have ever had! It didn't have a pool of oil (first time for everything!), it was so fresh, and I really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us, since we were sitting at the bar. I saw several other things (flatbread)  come out of that oven, and I will have to go back to try them! Everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious. I was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently ""better than baba!""   Now for the drinks. Holy cow. I've been drinking a few years now, so safe to say, I've tried many, many drinks. Or so I thought. Coconut mojito anyone!? Made with Ciroc Coconut vodka!  As tasty as mojitos are, I don't get a long well with rum, so vodka was a pleasant surprise, and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level. I also tried the white sangria, another 5 stars. Great wine list too- Apothic Red is one of a few reds I like, and they have it!    The staff was top notch as well. I arrived shortly before a shift change, and both bartenders were personable and hard working, and truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing. I'm pretty bad with names unfortunately, or I would love to mention them.  I can't wait to go back! For drinks and food! I think I'd even go alone for lunch if I didn't have any company!"|1
I took my daughter there to get her nose pierced for her birthday, they were very nice and professional and made her feel comfortable.  Its a nice shop and they were very friendly and did a great job.  I will definitely recommend them!|1
i love this place. very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on. when i do, this is were i want to be at some point in the night. where else can i go and request the cramps? i...love...this...place, it makes me happy. i suppose i should go on and on about what it's like, but i won't. go and experience it for yourself.|1
"Dave at Dave's Ashtanga is the best yoga teacher. He is kind, considerate, patient and a very nice person. He will take the time to show you a yoga move or asana. He is very knowledgeable about different subjects. What I like best is once he said, ""here you can do nothing wrong."""|1
The best food I have found the area and the price is right.  You get so much food you have to take home.  Get there early to get a good seat fills up for lunch.  Priced just right.|1
Fast service, the woman who did my hair was great and it was the cheapest hair cut I've ever gotten. I was told that my hair cut looked better than when I was paying $200+|1
Mims Burger & Mexican Food was revealed to me by my sister and sometimes when I think about it (even when I JUST ate), my stomach growls.  The restaurant itself just SMELLS GOOD sitting there and waiting for your food to arrive.  The strange name would sort of, you know, ordinarily turn me off from trying the place because I think when restaurants serve this AND this they usually just serve two wildly different forms of food, both of which suck.  Mims serves legitimately good Mexican food, burgers, hotdogs and everything else.  Even if you're NOT in the area, it's worth going a bit out of your way for it.  Five stars.  Places don't get much better.|1
The best of all the Harkins. Better array of munchies and really friendly staff. Also, I wasn't overly carded on my inexpensive purchases. At the Superstition Springs location, I'm carded four times between the parking lot and my seat. Chances are...if I steal a credit card, I'm not gonna sit in the same spot for three hours awaiting the po-po.|1
my family and i hosted my sister's graduation sendoff here and it was a great event!  debbie in the events office as well as the staff she sent us to be of service throughout the event were wonderful.  food was delicious - we ordered buffet style (chicken milanese, sirloin steak, appetizers, and beverages) for about 150 people.   the tech staff was very helpful in setting up our equipment for a slide show as well as providing equipment for us to play our own music at the event.  servers were polite and accomodating to any of the guests' requests. and the facility is beautiful.  they even let me go super early in the morning being the type A personality i am to decorate myself and set things up.  overall wonderful experience with this resort and its staff. would love to host another event here in the future.  thanks, scottsdale plaza resort!|1
These dentists are great at explaining medical issues in a way that you can understand. They are honest and very smart. They don't take my insurance and I still go there (lets face it, dental insurance doesn't reimburse much, so it's only like a $15 difference for me to go out of network for a cleaning). I would never go anywhere else!|1
ouchh...my fuckin head is pounding this morning.  thanks a lot guys!|1
Screw Disneyland- Sephora is the happiest place on earth!  They have everything a girly girl or a girly guy could possibly dream of and then some! They have all the best brands in cosmetics, skin care and perfume and they're always adding new items to their extensive product selection.  To me, getting a gift card to Sephora is like having Christmas morning over and over again.  Everywhere you look there are sparkly blushes, lip plumping glosses, lash-extending mascaras and anti-aging face creams- what more could anyone ask for? I can understand why men might hate going into Sephora- but they do have some products for guys too- although not many.  As far as I know, Scottsdale Fashion Square is home to the only Sephora in Scottsdale, but even as great as it is, it still can't beat the one right on the strip in Vegas.  They're open really late and you can shop with a drink in your hand- what could be better than that?|1
One of my favorite places  to get Indian food. I'm vegan so I love that there is so much  to choose from. My all time favorite is the chili gobi and vegetable manchurian. I'm so glad Udupi reopened.|1
I went in at 8 on a Thursday night, and the place was pretty empty except for a family of 4 eating.  The layout is a little strange, it looks like you should order at the big window with the kitchen behind it, but you actually order in the back right corner of the restaurant.  The girl who took my order was very friendly and made my fat ass feel welcome there, which is pretty rare these days.  She suggested I do the slider plate, which I did with a side of green chili mac and cheese and cornbread.  It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out, which is probably a good sign that they were at least spending some time cooking something back there.  The sliders were awesome, all the meat was very moist and full of smoky flavor, my favorite out of the three was definitely the pulled pork.  The green chili mac and cheese was also very good, which was somewhat surprising to me.  I was expecting Stouffer's with pickled jalapenos stirred in, but it was far from that.  For being the end of the night, it was very fresh and cheesy.  The only part of the meal that wasn't great was the cornbread, but I don't think you can really do much to cornbread to make it wow you anyway.  I definitely like this better than Honey Bears, and it doesn't even compare to the BBQ joke Famous Dave's.  When I have tailgate this year, Andrew's will definitely be my go to place for everything.  Also, my meal only ran me about $8.50 and it was very filling and worth every penny.|1
I love their menu!  The garlic mashed potatoes-amazing!  Steak-melts in  your mouth!  Service - great!  Big fan of Applebee's!|1
Great spa... If you don't mind spending a few bucks, this is the place for you. Neat water fall room, roof top pool, and eucalyptus room! I've had multiple massages here & they were exceptional. Outstanding customer service too.|1
"I stumbled across this restaurant several years ago after becoming frustrated with the generally 2 hour wait, (no matter what day) at a DIFFERENT pizza restaurant in Heritage square, downtown Phoenix.  Although the pizza was terrific at that ""other"" restaurant in Heritage square, I had a pretty UNBELIEVABLE experience....I was with a date, we waited the 2+ hours, had a really good dinner, salad, an appetizer and pizza.  We decided we wanted another pizza and when we asked our server for another, we were told that we could not because there was a line of people waiting to get in.  I was amazed.  We left knowing we would NEVER go back.  I heard about La Piazza al Forno not long after that experience.....I truly believe things happen for a reason.  The pizza was even better and has been consistant ever since.  The service was very warm and friendly, literally like a family welcoming me into their home.  I learned that night, that it was one big family run business.  Oh and by the way, the best...did I say BEST pizza that I not only have had in AZ, but NY has nothing over them!  Icing on the cake, the prices are VERY reasonable! I GOTTA have a fix every 10 days! For the longest time I didn't want to tell anyone about my secret, however, they DESERVE to be known!  AWESOME!!!"|1
One of a kind place to experience all senses!!  Food was great, service was great, AND they have a Moroccan Healer on staff.  Ask to taste the Moroccan Black Stone (not on normal menu).  I won't spoil how it makes you feel, but trust me when I say you will enjoy yourself! ;)|1
This place is just so so rad. It was about time that AZ has a high end sneaker boutique.  The selection of sneakers as well as clothes is above all. No kidding. I bought a pair of limited edition Jordans as a gift here. All of the sneakers here a so unique and fun, and it really puts the fun in sneaker shopping again.   Sure, you can go to finish line and get a pair of sneakers there. And you will see various other people wearing the same ones. If you really want to find funky stuff to express yourself with, this is the place. AND to make it even better...they sell for retail! So markups? Not an issue.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out...|1
Just got 5 Diamond Dermabrasion  On Arms, Back and Face and I Love it  She is a perfectionist,  Organize, Clean, and the most amazing quality service  she finished my facial with Ice I basically melted This is My Best present for My coming B Day  this Sunday I will Look like I am in High School this weekend with m Super Fresh Skin PaulGStudio.com highly recommends this better that The Red Door service and amazing and real Customer Service.

I needed new tires & 2 months later my husband. Both experiences the staff went out of their way to either get it done on time or make it work price wise! I have always used them for my tire needs and we travel for jobs so we need them a lot,|1
Finally, a great place to get breakfast that isn't Denny's or iHop in Gilbert. Came here with my family and we just made it before the change in menus.   The griddle bread pudding was AMAZING! Probably the highlight of the meal. We also ordered the veggie sandwich, All-American breakfast (?), a slice of red velvet cake.    We have definitely found our go-to Breakfast joint when my sister and I, both come back to Gilbert to visit the 'Rents.|1
"I think its about time I wrote a formal review for this establishment, considering I have recently bestowed it as ""My Favorite Restaurant"" - that's a big title to carry.   I often judge Mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and Gallo Blanco passes that test.  They have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle - as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico.  Their chunky guac is delish and summery, as they put orange slices in it.   Although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz (I think it taste like Cheez-Its), their best appetizer is the Elote - grilled corn-on-the-cob with cheese on it. It literally melts in your mouth! Oh, and it doesn't get stuck in your teeth like most corn-on-the-cobs tend to.   The orange cake is AMAZING and reminds me of my beloved red velvet - except, you know, orange.   I love everything about this restaurant - salsas, food, drinks, atmosphere, prices, entertainment (on Wednesday!) - they just need to get rid of that damn giant, ugly, silver air conditioning thing they have running through the bar."|1
I liked this place. The reviews show low stars but I liked it. I was there for happy hour so go at that time. The pricing is good. I don't know about dinner, but happy hour is cool.  Servers were chill.  Host was a bit stuck up. Not sure why she though she was that great. But the place is cool. I recommend people check it out if they want to try a sushi place on the Mill ave when you are in town visiting Tempe.|1
Never disappointed with this place!  Get the brisket, get the pork. Get the beans. They're bangin'!!!!!! The sauce is delicious the mac and cheese is pretty good, the cheesy potatoes are good too. The real standouts I would have to say are the brisket and the beans. Do NOT skip the beans. Trust me.   I'm not even a meat person but I do like Joe's because everything is cooked just right. Order extra of everything and you will be glad you did. Makes for great leftovers. Don't forget to get some BBQ sauce too. Personally, I'm not one to douse everything in BBQ sauce, just a little dip here and there, but the sauces are really good.   Even my young niece and nephew enjoy the food. It's simple, down-home good food even the pickiest eaters can enjoy. I've never actually dined-in at this place. I've always called in an order for pick up or ordered right at the take-out window. They are pretty fast.  My future father-in-law wants me to choose Joe's to cater our wedding rehearsal dinner. Did I really ever imagine in my wildest princess wedding dreams that I would choose BBQ for my rehearsal dinner? Not really, but Joe's is excellent, and we're heading toward a laid-back wedding theme anyway to take it easy on our many out-of-town family and friends. I am sure they will all love Joe's and I can't wait for them to try it!|1
I am not one to hang out in Downtown Phoenix before or after an event because quite frankly it's boring.  However, when I visited Copper Blues on 2/4/12 prior to the comedy show next door I will definitely be hanging out after events.  Here's Why ... They have a live band and over sixty beers on tap.  It's a nice cozy environment especially if you sit outside.  Budweiser drafts were only $5 and soda was only $3.  We didn't try their food but I hear the same owner owns both Copper and Stand Up Live so I am sure the kitchen is the same so I am confident in saying that the food is delicious because it was at Stand Up Live.  Happy hour is 4PM to 7PM Sun-Thurs so its basically perfect when any event is taking place during on those days.  On this Satuday night people were having a good time.  The draft beer was perfect and fresh.  The music was good and the bartender was real friendly and answered all of our questions cheerfully.  We had such a great time that me and my wife are going back to Copper Blues on 2/23/12 to hang out and drink with friends prior to our comedy show next door.  This is a nice spot and you have to check it out especially if you are going to the show next door !|1
I had the terrible decision to make to euthanize my 20 year old cat, Bandit. I was going to go to the Emergency Animal Clinic off of Scottsdale Rd. further north but I had previously had a bad experience there. I saw there were some good reviews for this Emergency Animal Hospital and, thank God I did. They were so kind and compassionate. They let us take our time, never rushed us. They knew it was a very painful thing to have to do. They made one of the worst things I have ever had to do as 'easy' as they possibly could have. They eased my nagging doubts about it without putting words in my mouth. I am ever grateful for their kindness on that incredibly sad day and would recommend them to anyone who has an animal friend who needs some emergency care.|1
I love this place! I love that it's to-go only (no 3 hour waits, like Pizzaria Bianco), and the mozzarella is mouth watering.  Please try the mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich. You won't regret it!|1
I go to Regio's a lot; today I went and want to reiterate how great I think it is.  I have been going there for a couple years - have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered.  Their beans are delicious, as is their menudo (only on Saturday and Sunday, unfortunately), and eveything else: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, etc, etc, etc. is great.  It is so inexpensive it's hard to believe.  Today my bff and I had 5 tacos and an order of beans (between us) and it was $10. HELLO! We had the mini-tacos, but we were stuffed and left there saying how wonderful it was and how full we were.   Check it out next time you're in the mood for some awesome, authentic Mexican food.  You will be glad you did.  Yummy.|1
Every time I visit Arizona I love to eat here to food is vary good and I have my wife to thank for turning me on too this restaurant I wish they would have some in Georgia|1
Just when I'm about to give up on my search for good Thai around Glendale, I stumble upon a true diamond in the rough. Don't be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza; the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle Thai ornaments and design. A huge desk in the lobby and bigger one inside the dining hall gives this establishment an odd but distinct hotel feel. Much like that feeling, the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door.   The food that I've tried here so far is... may I say it... divine. I started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste. Score. I also tried some papaya salad and once again, it was mounded in fish sauce and chili. Splendid. Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow (which is not on the menu) and lo and behold, I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way. To be honest... the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well. You can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of Mormonic proportions. You can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce, again drizzled all over your concoction. Let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre. It will pay off handsomely.|1
Cant say enough good things about Sens. Excellent food and excellent service.|1
What a great surprise stumbling across this bank!  Open 7 days a week with lobby service  I have banked with the Mega Uber Banks and have been nickeled and dimed (literally) with service fees.  I opened both a savings and checking account here.  Since my company does not offer direct deposit the associate told me I would have to have a traditional checking account with service fees.  I'm thinking - here we go again.  But it was one of those think on your feet moments.  Off they went (I'll assume to get approval).   They let me open up a type of checking account that only charges you for check printing - No other fees and pays interest.  In fact, if you use a non-MidFirst Bank ATM, they will refund you the service fees.  How refreshing with the current state of banking.|1
One of my favorite places to satisfy my sweet tooth!  I typically will get sorbet, and on this evening I decided to get the Raspberry sorbet.  I believe that this Gelato Spot location has the nicest ambiance of all the locations.  After getting my sorbet, I enjoy sitting out on the patio.|1
I have been going to Mesha's Salon and Spa for the past 5 years and absolutley love it. I see Michelle (the owner) and she comes up with some great new looks for me.  I have gone from short hair, funky styles and colors and long and sexy hair. She is awesome and I love her recommendations. There have been times I have gone in and not knowing what to do... and she always comes up with something that makes me feel fabulous !! I will never go anywhere else.|1
This little joint is right down the street from my crib and I've had the chance to dine here on several occasions (take out and dine in). Each and every time its been great! Extremely fresh ingredients and even better prices!! Great local place to get some great grub on a small budget. Highly recommended!|1
Wow...  I regress into some sort of '90s Valley Girl stereotype when chirping in delight over how good Switch is! How I was missing  a review for a Short List restaurant that I recommend to ev-er-yyyyy one I meet who is new to Phoenix and even remotely cool!?  Switch is reliably good food served in a reliably good atmosphere by reliably good servers. The combination of service, setting and grub makes Switch a go-to for affordable dining that has appeal for a wide variety of people. If I think that someone might be too uptight or too culinarily 'safe' to really enjoy Fez I know that I can take them to Switch, they can hone in on comfort food basics and I will still have an enjoyably awesome dining experience myself because all the basics are done with love, care and actual effort.   I think I prefer Switch's menu to Fez's because of the combination of classic choices mixed in with flavor play and more diverse fare. And we end up at Switch a lot because they have awesome outdoor loungey space which works for friends who are smokers and for a quieter, more intimate chic and cool dinner-drinks and gossip night.   It's really a gift to have this place in Downtown and a real gem in the Valley overall.  We have on occasion had our asses kicked by the bar, specifically by the Drunken Italian Sodas which are so very, very good!|1
We showed up out of the blue on Valentine's night looking for food. We got a seat at the sushi bar right away, but the place was otherwise packed. I guess we were lucky. We passed on the V-day prix-fixe menu and decided to order as we ate.  Our waitress was visibly perturbed by my wife's order of tap water to drink and vegetable tempura to start. Judging by her expression, she took us for deadbeats; it wasn't offensive but hilarious, we're old enough to be confident in our own opinions of ourselves. Anyway, the vibe at the W was definitely people trying hard to be cool and of-the-moment.  In any event, we struck up a conversation with the chef behind the bar where we were sitting. We initially ordered some basic sashimi dishes, but when I asked the chef for suggestions, he started rattling off a series of custom creations he could make. So we let him do his best, and he turned out a great collection of sashimi dishes, none, at least as far as I could tell, on the menu.   We had a great meal, and we would definitely return, at least if we didn't live in San Diego.  (The waitress eventually warmed up, probably thawing as she watched us eat through plate after plate of sashimi....)|1
"We went here for my wife's birthday, and it's a rare 5-star review for me. They scored on food, presentation, service and atmosphere. We sat indoors - it's a bit hot out still - and loved the decor, including the fun pillows on our large booth seat. Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive - but we never felt rushed. They make a killer mango mojito that perfectly balances the mango, lime and rum flavors. The kurobuta pork was perfectly prepared. And after having some disappointing lobster (in Maine of all places) the Maine lobster here was done just right - firm but not tough. They serve it ""lazy style"" and did a great job with both claw and tail meat coming out perfectly. A special birthday souffle topped the evening off. Expensive but absolutely worth it for a special occasion."|1
Excellent in every way.  Attentive and fun owners who tend bar every weekend night - GREAT live music, excellent wine selection.   Keeping Fountain Hills young.... one weekend at a time.|1
This is hands down the best burrito in the East Valley! Fav's is always consistent and their prices are excellent! My standard meal is a California Carne Asada burrito, it comes with the most tender carne asada I've ever had. Also, their green and red sauce is a step above the competition, and they have great mexican rice, it comes with peas and carrots! Guac is exceptional, and they also have really tasty breakfast burritos that are available all day. Five stars for being consistent, clean and for having pleasant and professional employees! One more thing is that they close at midnight except for Sunday when they close at 10. Bummer but still the best!|1
Love the wings!|1
Love this place !  Food is spicy and always cooked just right.  Menu changes every so often and have nightly specials too.  Service is great.  No matter what night you go it is busy.  it is a great little find.|1
I was in this area and went here for lunch today based on the Yelp reviews. I had a molete and lengua, fish, and pastor tacos. Washed it all down with a Mexican coke, made an awesome lunch! Everything was so good I ordered a shrimp burrito to go and shared it with a friend after I left. I'll be back to try more things next time I'm in the area!|1
"I love pueblo pediatric also!  And, also surprised there aren't any reviews! There staff is always friendly and helpful. Rooms are always clean.  I take my baby to Dr. Salek. He always answers all of our questions and never makes us feel ""stupid"" for asking. He also takes his time and even asks us how we are doing. Most physicians these days are in and out of the room before you can even feel like your questions are answered, but Dr. Salek really takes his time.  I went in during a very busy day...flu season actually.  My baby had a fever and I called the office to fit me in. They did surprisingly and I saw Dr. Salek. He examined my baby and reassured me his fever is fighting off infection and not to worry.  Well as any mom, I was worried and continued with my questions...I was there for 30 min with him and not once did he make me feel rushed. I even thanked him for squeezing us in and he replied ""we would rather stay later to see all our sick patients than to send you to urgent care because we are overbooked"".  Now that's what I call service...if only MY doctor would fit me in and not send me to urgent care! I haven't seen the other physicians but am sure they are just as good! Also, they are a private practice from what I know so each physician owns part of the practice...meaning they take pride in what they do!"|1
Elmer, I love you.  I have since I was a senior at Chandler High. Back then I was broke so I could only get a bean burrito and strips...and they were dang good.   If anyone wants to complain about strips just being chips and cheese they can suck it.  Now days I am a little less broke so I always get the green chili burro. And it is always so good. Spicy enough to burn a little and the tortilla is always fresh...thanks man.  And bless your little Mexican Heart, you serve corn dogs...so I can even come here with my crazy picky kids.   I love you Elmer. I always will.|1
Bookmans is Great!  They probably don't need another positive review but so what.  I use Bookmans for recycling books I've read and for buying used books for myself.  All I can say is that I like everything about the way they do business.  They have great people working there.  The store vibe is very positive.  Their prices are very fair and what they pay for your used books is incredibly fair, plus you know that you've made a positive contribution to our society by recycling books that others can enjoy.  Do yourself a favor and stop in.  Enjoy!|1
This place is such a delightful treat. Not only is the Barrio Cafe in what some Phoenicians would called the actual barrio, but it's non-descript on the outside and purely magical within. Not terribly difficult you keep your eyes peeled, Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona and is a must try for any Phoenix local.   You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, although their seafood offerings are my least favorites. I am in love with their conchita pibil, which is their slow-roasted pork and they have the best made-at-the-table guacamole in all of Phoenix. Their food is the kind of special occasion dinner that you and all your guests will be savoring every morsel, but save room for one of their delectable desserts! I'm a fan of their flan, in particular.   Service is spot on and it's usually pretty packed, so come as early as you can or face a semi-long wait at the bar. Don't worry though, they've got great margaritas. This is the place Tempe's Mucho Gusto wished it could be some day. But it probably won't.|1
...the customer service alone gets 5 stars, but when you factor in the semi-annual sales it is more like 6.  Having been to a number of Nordstrom's in multiple cities I'd put this particular location on the same level as those in San Francisco (without the assinine traffic to contend with) and Seattle and only a notch below the best of the best in Chicago.    Living in a city with a Nordstrom and a Nordstrom Rack is going to be a daily exercise in resisting temptation.|1
Best pizza I've had anywhere.  Perfect, perfect and I mean perfect crust.  Thin, chewy, smoky and sweet.  Lots of interesting toppings that center around fresh, local produce.  I deeply envy the regulars here.|1
Great Mexican food.  Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes.  Halibut tacos remind me of Ensenada Michelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish.|1
Love the shows the promoters bring in. Cozy spot where I've seen Owl City, A Fine Frenzy, Landon Pigg and more. Plus they are generous with the Malibu Rum :) You will need to visit the bar to get your own as I've never really seen cocktail servers. Oh well...   Atmosphere is laid back, chill. A large patio. And yes, the Shaker Room. The hot, shake your stripper ass, place to be.|1
"I am a huge ""foodie"", from a long line of ""foodies"". I grew up living in hotels and on room service and fine dining. This is the best, very best, breakfast restaurant EVER! I have been living in Tempe for about six years now, the first two sad sad years I did not know that this wonderful place existed...after my first visit, this is my go-to, best place to recommend, favorite breakfast place to eat at! If you go on a Sunday, it will be very very busy. Everyone is super friendly. The place is very clean. Prices are amazing! Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food. Huge portions and great quality food. I have never had a bad experience here, and to be honest...even if I did, I wouldn't care. I feel like home here. Everything on the menu is delicious! I've tried almost everything. Here are a few of my favorites (don't forget though, I love it all) : O'Pear Grenache Omelette, Greek Fetash Omelette, English Harvest Omelette, Huevos Con Chorizo (with scrambled eggs), and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes (pancakes! you can order half an order or little ones...we always get an order to share at the table). Their potatoes are delicious and crispy, the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing! I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts! Just delicious! I wish everyone knew about this well kept secret. DON'T LISTEN TO ANY REVIEW UNDER A 5 STAR! This place is the best, bottom line. Try it. You will be hooked."|1
Great food and even better beer. Staff are always friendly.  My favorite microbrewery in the Valley.|1
I love sakana. They have the best lunch time happy hour! Its always delicious and seriously reasonably priced. :)|1
The food in this place is indescribably awesome! Granted, the place could be nicer, but if you're in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place: this is it. The service is fast, friendly, and the prices are great- especially knowing that their portions are typically huge. I can't finish my plate most of the time, so I always end up taking leftovers home.  I love their Jade Red Chicken, as well as their emerald chicken. Their black beans are to die! Order a combo plate, if this is your first time here. You'll get a good mix of everything and you'll leave without regrets!|1
Cholla Trail is a lot of fun and moderate hike. Echo Canyone is a lot of fun but also more challenging. Overall both trails are so much fun and a great workout.|1
I've been really impressed with John Skiba and his professionalism. He is always up to date on everything in bankruptcy law and I've enjoyed reading his blog posts. It really shows his expertise and passion for what he does. Hopefully I will never need his services but if I ever were to need an Arizona bankruptcy attorney I would go to him first for sure.|1
Quick, friendly, awesome.|1
Found the Tuck Shop on my Urban Spoon AP and what a grand surprise it ended up being!   In the heart of Coronado this little house has been transformed to a true Phoenix jewel! The food was amazing..we had pork with a pasta and broccoli.  The pork had two amazing sauces that my boyfriend I argued over which was the better.  The pasta was okay a bit of a cumin flavor but great once we mixed it with the pork's sauce.  The broccoli was a great fresh touch.   The manager came over and spent some time talking to us more about the menu and plans to open another place with a different menu soon.  A must try if you are a down town kinda person!   The crowd  was a mix of tshirts casual to formal and the patrons ages ranged just as much.  The menu changes with the season so go check it out!  Only complaint I've heard from people I've recommended was the lack of choice if you are a vegetarian.|1
"i moved to the tempe area about 2 weeks ago from socal, the mecca for asian restaurants.  since moving out here, my only taste for asian food has been panda express.  well, i was craving teriyaki last night but had no idea where to go so i did a search here.  tokyo house got a bunch of great reviews and everyone mentioned a cool old man behind the counter so i just had to check this place out.  as soon as i walked in the door, i was greeted by the old man...from across the joint, behind the counter, mind you.  he was SUPER nice and SUPER funny!    checked out the menu and the selection was a bit overwhelming!  they have every teriyaki dish available, and bunch of fried rice and noodle choices, and for those that like rabbit food, vegetable dishes.  i was a bit surprised though to not see gyoza or pot stickers on the menu...was bummed out about that.  i had a hard time deciding what to get but remembered Sarah W.'s review of the house chicken, so i went with that.  i went with a large order and let me tell you; if you're hungry, you definitely will be stuffed after a large order.  the dish was very tasty and delicious and was definitely overflowing with mushroom.  i love mushroom!  the house chicken is supposed to be spicy and although it had a little kick, it wasn't the ""spicy"" i was used to from asian joints in socal.  i wish it had a bit more rice, though.  either way, the dish was great!  i would definitely order it again!  i highly recommend this joint.  you will be treated well by the cool old man behind the counter, the place is clean, the servings are generous and the  price is cheap!"|1
Pizza has been delicious and fresh every time I've been there. The Chipotle pasta is absolutely the best though.|1
My husband and I have been going to the Touch of Thai for years. We meet up there at least twice a month for a lunch date. On special occasions we take friends and family there for dinner. I love the wait staff - especially Nick! His wonderful sarcasm and jokes always make our day!   For the amount of food you get at lunch at the price they charge - you can't beat it. Everything is homemade and tastes fresh. #3 Yellow Curry is my hubby's favorite. Rich coconut based sauce with yellow curry. The chicken is tender and the potatoes and carrots are cooked perfectly. I venture off and try things from time to time. The food is spicy. I like the incorporation of fresh herbs into the dishes. The soup served with lunch is always yummy and changes from time to time. We always get a side order of spring rolls. You need to try these! I like the Pad Thai as well as the #5 and #7 lunch specials. Meals are served fairly quickly.   Sometimes we have to get up and refill our own water glasses however I find this to be a wee bit charming. Feels like I am home. If you go there on a regular basis the servers remember you, have your order into the kitchen before you even are seated, and always say hello and smile.|1
A small bite goes a long way. I first was introduced to these brownies in '09 when I received a variety box with 12 sprites and a can of cocoa for Christmas. I love the packaging - the deep purple and brown on the box and wrapper. After devouring my first brownie, I was an instant fan. The card in the box said you can freeze the brownies for up to a month but it was gone within the week. The can of cocoa lasted for a good 3 months. I used it for baking - cookies, breads, cakes, etc.   My faves: Cream Cheese, Espresso Nib, Toffee Crunch, and Caramel.  The sprites are just the perfect size because it's just enough to get your chocolate fix but not overwhelming. I just throw one in my purse before I leave the house and I can have it with my coffee in the afternoon.   I'm a subscriber of their email so I've been receiving emails with discount codes and free shipping. It's so hard to resist. Lucky me, I stumbled on a Groupon several months ago and I got a box of 24 Sprite for almost half the price plus shipping.|1
Tasty Thai- is. But it could also be called Delicious Thai. And the service is always great!|1
Now open on Saturdays!!!! Yes!!!!!|1
Some of the best coffee I've ever had -- and I lived in Portland. Insanely good selection & product. Tanzanian peaberry off the charts. Owner gets beans from multiple sources to ensure that his selection is the best.|1
Best in town!!|1
this place is awesome. GO. & soon - already decent wait times.   OH, pitches of pbr for 7 bucks. yeah, yeah. shut up.  GO GO GO.|1
This is my favorite coffee spot in AZ.  They know how to make a fantastic Americano.  They use very good coffee and a real European espresso machine.  I hate those machines that Starbucks uses with the coffee storage on top and the preset grinders.  YUCK.    The cafe has a comfortable and welcoming Vice.  Everyone will say hello to you when you walk in the door.  They do have free wifi, but it is REAL SLOW!!  That is my only complaint.  They need to crank it up!|1
"Beautiful little gem of a restaurant.  Great outdoor seating, amazing-truly amazing mussels.  Wholeheartedly recommend, perfect ""date night"" too."|1
Doc and Edwards has been a place of refuge for 5 years for me.  Hell, most of my friends spent their 21st birthday there.  It is hard to explain walking into a bar and just feeling at home.  It is so comfortable and wide open.  Even on the most crowded days, I feel like I am on the cast of cheers.  The employees there are good and the food is exactly what you expect.  You can also order silvermine there with no delivery charge!  The pool table rates have gone up in the last few years but if you spend a good amount of money on drinks, they waive the pool table fee. Or you could go for some ping pong, foosball, UFC, or big buck hunting.  It has a great juke box but watch out for the lady that throws 20 in and slangs the worst playlist I have ever heard. If my girl would only let me, I would have my wedding there.|1
I've been to this Dick's location a bunch of times and I've got to say that I've gotten more help from the employees in this one that I've ever gotten from any other location.  I've spent some major time with the guys in the gun dept and they're always more that helpful regardless of how busy and how many people they have waiting for them.  Major props to those guys for good knowledge and patience.  Another time I was there I wanted some new shorts for softball and they didn't have and L's left but jokingly I checked the Under Armour manikin as he was wearing the same shorts, and what do ya know... L.  It was near closing time and the associates were getting their stuff done so they could go home (I've worked retail and I know at closing time you just want everybody to bail so you can clean and go home).  I asked a girl around the corner I was able to rob the manikin of his clothes and she laughed and had no problem taking him apart and yankin the shorts right off!  I was so happy as I had a game the next day and didn't want to be running around looking for these shorts.  Think I'm joking? lol - http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryno/4113416766/  Anyways - good store, always clean and everybody seems very nice and knowledgable in their area.  Never had an issue there.|1
Dr Natalie is a compassionate, empathetic, caring DC. She listens, takes her time with you and always strives not only to make you feel better, but to keep you feeling better. Her new location is adorable. I highly recommend her!|1
Inside the Clarendon Hotel in central Phoenix, Gallo Blanco has quickly made a hit for themselves with hipsters and urban dwellers alike. They offer a refreshing alternative for hotel restaurants, with lively ambiance and great food and drink.  Gallo Blanco's tacos are surefire hits. They're served individually, and come lined up in an appealing silver taco stand. We've ordered the carne asada and shrimp soft tacos, and, wow, they're really mouthwatering. The shrimp is flame grilled and seared, bringing out a nice full flavor. The guacamole is slightly sweet and chunky, and paired with outstanding tortilla chips, this is a must-order appetizer. Even the sauces (I prefer the red chipotle one) are addictive, either to accompany the supreme tacos, or to be enjoyed alone on chips.  This restaurant is a fine addition to the emerging downtown Phoenix foodie scene, and with prices extremely reasonable, you get a lot. A good sized meal for two (sans drinks) could ring up at $30-35, which is a good value for great food. Try Gallo Blanco, bring friends, and get a bunch of items. Although I haven't explored the rest of the menu, I sense that Gallo Blanco's items don't stray far from excellence.|1
After four years of living in AZ I finally found Mexican food that appeals to me and my husband. Lets just say they changed my husbands view on tacos. He never swayed from eating vegetarian burritos until he got a hold of their carne asada tacos. In the last 4 months we lived in AZ we went there almost every week and brought friends, whom now can't get enough of them too. They are reasonably priced, have great customer service and everything we have eaten so far has been fabulous. If you are looking for great food and you're not concerned with being in a fine dining Mexican restaurant, then look no further.  We miss you Los Taquitos.....|1
If you want Cheap go to Walmart!   But if you want authentic eclectic trinkets that you will proudly own and showcase in your home this is the place for you!|1
i tried the thai river noodles. they will not replace the love i have for a dan dan noodle bowl. but the thai noodles, they were good.  i like this place because it has really opened hours compared to everything else around here. and the food in inconsistent. oh also, the new soda machines are very entertaining. just watch....  this is usually a last resort option (everything else in the area is closed). but it is a good one nonetheless.|1
This place always pleases! Their sandwiches are always great, bread is great, pizza is AWESOME, and their short ribs are great. The food is SO fresh! The waiters are kind and friendly. When we asked if they had some of their awesome ice cream, she kindly told us the freezer broke. I heart the deli!|1
Went here tonight with the padres and husband.  This place is the whole Joes BBQ/Joes Farm Grill owners.  We saw that it was the highest rated here on Yelp for restaurants in Gilbert.   Paper menus are available near the counter where you order your meal.  We started with the Hummus + olives appetizer.  Mom and I shared the Apricot Chicken with mashed sweet potatoes, Dad had some steak sandwich with horseradish that was very tasty, husband had the Salmon BLT with avacado.  I tasted everything and ALL the food was delicious!!   There were also very interesting and unique beer and wine offerings.  There is an espresso bar that sells various coffees, as well as some sweet stuff.  There is still a little market in the back selling local olive oil from Queen Creek Olive Oil Mill, as well as pasta, pure vanilla extract and other items.  I highly recommend a trip to Liberty Market for a fresh, home-cooked meal.|1
LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!  always need to find a reason to drive so far to Chandler:-)  so fresh, soup delish, and sauces yummy!!! BYOB, and casual...feels like my grandmas:-)|1
My wife and I found Four Peaks by chance. We got lucky. The food was great, service was great, and all thr beers rocked. My wife's fav was the Heff and the Arizona Peach. We got a beer glass to remember the occasion and plan to swing by on the way out and grab a growler.|1
girlfriend and i always stop here on our treks to lee lee market.  If you haven't tried pho (pronounced fuh) , this is a great spot.  Basically its a beef soup thats a thousand times tastier than campbells.  its served with a plate of crisp and fresh veggies, like bean sprouts, jalapenos, basil, etc,  that you can throw in the soup.   i recommend using the spicy sauce that has roasted garlic in it instead of sriacha.   we also had the lemongrass beef salad which was equally good.  Everything is fresh and tasty with great service.    make sure you take dobson for the easiest entrance as pho ao sen is facing west!|1
My first and only experience there was excellent. The service was exemplary - the server knew the menu, was enthusiastic about it, and assisted us in choosing our items without being pushy. The food was exceptionally prepared and tasted excellent. The tzatziki was the best I've had. Nice and thick, with cucumber and spiced well with herbs and garlic. The spanikopita was also exceptionally with fresh clean tasting spinach and delicately textured phyllo dough. The pan fried calamari reminded me of Europe, fresh tasting, delicately fried in olive oil and not in the least bit chewy. The pita bread was warm and fresh and for dessert, the baklava had a complex flavor and tasted home made.   The environment was tasteful, old world European and exceptionally clean and organized. I will be back!|1
Being Indian, and having grown up in London, I have been pretty spoilt for Indian food. Imagine my dismay when I moved to Phoenix! I've tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time I've left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come.  Couple of friends introduced me to this place a few months ago and I'm stoked. It's not as good as the stuff back home. And I'm sure you can get better in San Francisco or New York. But if you are looking for something closer to home you can't go wrong.  Plus its got the real live Indians eating in there too. Can't be bad!!|1
Simply awesome! Great beer and great staff! Will try the food next time! Only complaint is a bartender named Adrianne she is crazy! Ha! G  The food was excellent from the great hard boiled egg dish to the peanut butter and jelly with banana and marshmallow fluff oh and add bacon.  Elvis just did a sommersault in his grave.  The sandwiches are not huge but they are all made like the beer served and the people hosting, of finest quality!    Really enjoyed and will spread the word!|1
The people at this title company are as good as it gets. They are eager to do a really good job for the agents that use them.  Bill Risser and Paul Guenther are techno pros regarding the Social Media techniques and readily share their expertise and time to teach the skills of Twitter, Facebook, Hootsuite, and  other aspects of Social Media which agents can utilize to serve their clients in a diligent and efficacious manner.  The buyers and sellers of  property will really gain by using them because their handling of the transaction will be efficiently and quickly finished.|1
The grooming salon at this location does an amazing job with pets. Yesterday was the 2nd time my baby was groomed here by Chip.  I hope I spelled his name correctly, he's just wonderful.  He's very patient and very kind with my Sushi-poo and I'm comfortable leaving him in Chip's hands.|1
Brought a friend from Louisiana here.  She says that the crawfish etouffee here is the best she's had outside of Louisiana!|1
"The first couple of times I ate here I wasn't sure why people were always so crazy for this place. It's been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months I've already been here like three times and wanted to go back more. I've decided that it's all about what you order; for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings, have fun! Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try. Also, don't be afraid to speak up. I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didn't pay attention. Now I ask for lots of lettuce and they're happy to make it the way I like. They make their breads fresh and they have garlic-herb bread that has lots of flavor. I won't order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing. I am a picky ranch eater...I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesn't taste or resemble mayo. I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor. They have the best home made ranch dressing here! Pair it with the garlic-herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor. OMG! Wipe...sorry I just started to drool a bit. Service is good...everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant. My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich...I get the Pinner (8"") but I swear some days I am so hungry I think I'm going to order the Blunt (12"")...maybe someday soon. All sandwiches get toasted. Okay so toppings: Guacamole, sprouts, lettuce/spring mix, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, black olives (I get mine w/o), cucumbers, pickles, your choice of cheese (I get Swiss), with their house goodies (EVOO, vinegar, herb mixture on top). Now that I found my sandwich, I crave it all the time and can't wait for my next visit. Oh, be sure to check their daily specials too! If you're lucky enough to be in their delivery area...well, darn you then! :-)"|1
This is a great hole in the wall shop off of Val Vista Rd. I've been getting the chicken salad sandwich since 2006 and it's the same ever since GREAT! Cookies and bread are awesome as well...|1
These little sliders are tasty, delicious and pretty speedy.  You get two and you can get them with or without grilled onions.  There is a home made type thousand island dressing on them that adds so much to these wonderous burgers!   Fries are 5 star as well...also enjoy the people watching...Scottsdale at its finest!|1
FnB is how every restaurant should be. Unfortunately this will not happen because Pavle Milic, who runs the place, cannot be at every restaurant.   This is a small, friendly restaurant in my hood, that just happens to have some of the best food you will find. I always feel welcomed & taken care of by the staff. I've come here with friends, but I've also come alone & felt totally welcome. I like sitting up at the counter, and I've actually met some really great people to chat with there. Pavle & his wife run the place, & they are the kind of people who always make you feel like they are glad you are there.  Chef Charlene does things with food that make it amazing, & these are things that I myself could never accomplish. My main cooking skills involve a microwave or a menu. I just wish I had the funds to eat here more often.  In conclusion, fabulous food combined with wonderful service make me feel lucky to have FnB in my neighborhood. :)|1
Excellent customer service, super clean, and the food's not bad at all.  Despite the fact that I asked for extra mayo on my sammy, but got NO mayo, was a little annoying.  But, for some reason, something told me to pick up some packets of mayo.  So I was in the clear and my annoyance never gained traction into anything that prevented me from returning.  That, and the sandwich was pretty yummo.  They also give a pickle and a free bag of chips to go with it.  I do not, however, recommend the chocolate chip cookie.  No bueno.|1
This is an awesome family owned business. We've had consistently fresh and delicious food each time we've been here. They homemake things like their ranch dressing to take them to a different level than other places. Highly recommend this place. Prices are not bad either.|1
"Highly recommend. This is my second time here and I see #3 on the way. I've had the (bistec encebollado & arroz imperial with shrimp ""no melted cheese"") I do recommend both plates. Next time I will try (ropa vieja) Great service! Ask for Kelly."|1
Don't usually give 5 stars, but this is good sushi. At first, I was a little skeptic of all the macadamia nuts on their sushi, but it is a great compliment. The rolls are original and all very good. The Climax('s) and the Elliot are my favorite.|1
Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo.  That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious.  I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby.|1
Why would I go to a restaurant and hope for the worst?  Because I'm a snob and as a snob I was convinced that The Capital Grille would fall short of my extremely high expectations.  Not so.  Bread basket: Outstanding onion bread, a pumpernickel/golden raisin bread, and some crisp cracker bread.  Nice all around.  Extensive wines by the bottle with some great values to be had.  I did not check by the glass.  Our wine was decanted artfully at our table and the staff had a ready knowledge of the vineyard and year we had selected.  Husband had:  Oysters -  Blue point tonight, small this time of year so no big surprise there, well prepared and delicious.  Lamb chop - Perfectly flavored and cooked, Frenched, the definition of how to prepare and cook a lamb chop perfectly.  Potato Au Gratin - Typical steakhouse Au gratin.  Excellent flavor, huge portion, guaranteed to please a crowd (or anyone that loves a delicious cheesy crusted potato).  I had:  Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella - You can't imagine how good this is....a lovely thin slice of prosciutto cooked to crisp perfection wrapped around a fresh piece of mozzarella cheese, with just the right amount of melt but not escaping the prosciutto shell.  A parmesan toast and tomato salad round this out.  You might as well as shaved gold on the side.  Sliced filet - I'm not going to go into detail, just know that the answer is YES! (Is it fantastic? Is it cooked to perfection? Is the flavor wonderful? Is it a great cut?)  Asparagus with Hollendaise - Awesome stuff.  Nice to have a great hollendaise that I didn't have to prepare.  Service - Our server was so outstanding I'm going to contact the manager at this location.  Atmosphere - We had a corner table that gave us great privacy.  We could not hear our neighbors.|1
A must for us when we visit Scottsdale.  Whole family finds what they like and the burgers are fantastic. Very well priced and easy to bring the family, have some wings, burgers a few beers and not break the piggy bank.|1
INCREDIBLE food, relaxed/great atmosphere, perfect to bring kids/family...the cheeseburger, shredded bbq pork sandwich, sweet potatoes- too die for! Must try! Worth the drive!|1
We have been taking our dogs to All-Star since they opened. The staff has always been great and remembers our girls by name, and the Vets are fantastic! Any Dr who will get down on the ground and love on my doggies is ok in my book. They have squeezed us in for emergency visits many times. We have also boarded our dogs here and they take awesome care of them. Just wish they were opened on the weekends|1
"I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a ""GOOD"" Pizza. After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza, I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia! I love the hole in the wall vibe! Just like home :) The sauce is great and super tasty! The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..It's what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!! I love it! My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads. I want to try their Philly Steak next, but for the time being I still make mine at home.  Every pizza place likes to say its ""New York Style"", but this place really does a NYC pizza. Well the best nyc pizza you're gonna get in AZ, Something about the water."|1
Thanks to Chris L's first review, OTFM has been on my list of places to go for quite some time.  Unfortunately, I just can't seem to get my act together on Saturday mornings.  Today was the day.  I was ready by 9 (am, not pm)!  After a quick stop at the ATM, we were there, Yelp canvas bags in hand, and not disappointed.  I had to get that chocolate cherry bread from Phoenician Bakery.  I sampled an itsy, bitsy little piece and it was still like heaven exploded in my mouth.  We also purchased zucchini bread, honey (which I've already mixed with some mascarpone cheese and slathered on strawberries), grapefruit marmalade (yum), dates, and fresh flowers.  The breakfast burritos from Gil's Taste of Taos were some damn good burritos.  Saving for next time...fresh produce (the lines were already long for McClendon's and I'm not one to wait for veggies) and everything else I wanted (like tamales).  We saw our own Gabi K's other half wandering down the street too...he looked so lost without her:(  Hope he brought her some flowers.|1
Best cajun food in town, not just from a truck.  Phoenix doesn't have the greatest selection of cajun offerings so I was amazed at Food Truck Friday to find Jamburrito.  They have a pretty stellar selection of meats & meals considering it's from a truck.  The spices were perfect - just spicy enough to enjoy but nothing that's going to harm.  I had the catfish once and the jamburrito twice... not in one sitting because the portions are VERY filling.|1
This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated.|1
"Honestly, I can't remember how I found out about Butter & Me, but I'm glad it happened.  My fiancee (now wife!) and I are addicted to cupcakes and we decided to swap the traditional wedding cake for some delicious cupcakes. Kelly at Butter & Me did not disappoint. She was absolutely fantastic to work with and has *the best* cupcakes in the valley! Believe me, we taste-tested a number of other vendors and everyone else's cupcakes tasted like small, dry, cakes.  The cupcakes from Butter & Me were exactly what we were looking for. They were perfectly moist, beautifully decorated, and there are a ton of delicious flavors to choose from!!!  I cannot recommend Butter & Me highly enough! The Yelp review sums it up: ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"""|1
"I was given a $100 gift card to use at Willow Stream Spa last December... I've been waiting for the perfect day to use it since then.  Well, guess what? Today was that day!  With my fiance out of town for the weekend, I took advantage of some much deserved ""Gabi time"" as I like to call my downtime.  I called a few days ago to make an appointment and I asked if there were any specials going on.  Lucky for me, there were several!  The one that was most appealing to me was the ""book any 60 or 90 minute treatment and get a complimentary 30 minute treatment to go with it.""  I chose to book a 60 minute aromatherapy facial and a 30 minute complimentary massage to go with it... I was in heaven!  I'll back up a moment and just say that I've been to the Willow Stream Spa before... years ago.  Today was even more heavenly than I remembered.  I checked in around noon and didn't leave until after 6pm.  I could've stayed longer, but I had to come home to take Minnie out!  The Willow Stream facility is gorgeous and includes every amenity you can imagine... I started out in the fitness room for a quick workout and then took a glorious shower before my massage and facial.  I had Tomi for my massage and she focused on my neck, back, and shoulders... (I've been having shoulder pain so I think she customized this based on my situation).  She was fantastic but with just 30 minutes, it felt like a tease... my facial made it all worthwhile though- it was pure bliss!  Heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job.  I highly recommend her - she explained every product she was using as I fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders, chest, neck, scalp, hands and feet... the products felt amazing and smelled good too.  So much so that I bought a couple on my way out.    After my services, I had lunch (a delicious salad with veggies and chicken) while I wrote some thank you notes and read my book... It was so peaceful.  It was like an escape from the world and I enjoyed every second of it!  So, bottom line - if you are thinking about getting a spa-lover like me a gift anytime soon, Willow Stream Spa giftcards are always welcome... what an experience!  I'm feeling energized, relaxed, and peaceful."|1
What can I say about this place? I love it. Its straight up the road from my place. You can find everything here, not just Asian food. When I get a hankering for Bombay spice, off to Lee Lee I go. I love LOVE their meat counter. I get chills deciding which pork hocks I want. The fish fry service is nice. They have stuff I can't live without and can't find anywhere else i.e. aloe vera juice and those sinfully delicious dessert rice and of course, the makoks. The cashiers can be a lil raunchy though just smile and nod. And a little known secret? The vegetables are freshest on Fridays.|1
Pulled pork over rice with compelling seasoned tater tots (rosemary & garlic).  Gutsy sauce was utterly unique!  Darryl King prepared it hot and packaged it with style for takeaway service.|1
Their emu oil is great.  I use it for inflammation of my jaw and shoulders, it's wonderful.  I highly recommend it.  We buy it at Fresh Vitamins in Mesa.  No dyes, fully refined, I love it.|1
This place was AMAZING!  I have stayed in probably over 100 hotels, this one was the BEST hotel I have ever been to... staff was extremely friendly, I WILL be back!|1
My husband and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Every time we drive by he wants to go in and eat. Even if we are driving home from a dinner we just had!!   1. The people that work there are AMAZING. They are so nice and hospitable, always glad to see you and let you decide the type of dining experience you want. (romantic date, take out, quick bar eats, etc.)   2. This is the freshest place for seafood I have found in Phoenix. I don't know how they find half of the stuff the serve, but they do, and it is just off the boat. (I lived in Boston for 3 years and they get stuff I crave, like Kumomato Oysters, all types of fish and meat from East Coast farms)   3. Pricing is right on...since they are serving stuff that is difficult to procure, I am always amazed at the value they present.    Keep Rocking Yasu!!!|1
I see Jenny Strebe who cuts and Veronica Peebles who colors. They are AMAZING! I am so glad they opened Salon Stylush, it is the perfect size (not too huge and crazy) and it is so modern & cute!   Jenny is an amazing hair stylist with the accolades to prove it (she styles hair for fashion shows, magazines, television, etc). Jenny has been cutting my hair for years and she is super sweet and super talented. I trust her with my hair, no question, and recommend her highly. Also, she has a talent for men's hair as well. She cuts my husband's hair and that is one of his best qualities (I'd say!). There are so many men out there with bad hair - Jenny knows how to make it work for men!  Veronica has colored my hair for years - and she is hands down one of the best in the industry. I never loved my color until I found Veronica. Now, I trust her completely and know she'll make my hair look great, and natural, which is important to me. She's also super sweet! I highly recommend Veronica as a stylist and colorist.|1
We drove in from LA for spring training.  Had a free evening and the old Pizza Hut remake looked interesting.  To our great surprise, we had one of the best Thai meals in a long time.  Once you get inside, you'll forget this used to be an old Pizza Hut and you'll be transported to a bit of Southeast  Asia.  Good food, good service...and the price is great.  I loved the eggplant with beef and the Pad See Yew (spelled differently).  Was going to go again, but they close on Sundays...boo.  Don't know if it's consistently this good, but for our one night in Phoenix, we were pleasantly surprised.  Definitely worth a try if you're looking for good Thai food.  You don't necessarily have to have a lot of heat in your food because they have plenty of dishes for chili-adverse people like me but it's there for those that need the heat.  The food presentation and description will remind you of Chinese cuisine, but the flavors are unique and delicious...and definitely NOT Chinese.  The Thai fried rice is definitely more than a side dish...it's a meal in itself.  Try this place and you won't be disappointed.|1
Count us in for a #5 Combo, a Oaxaca Special & two hard tacos....maybe some chips and salsa to go!  Best Mexican fast food around..and cheap!  Always busy at lunch, but they get through the orders in a timely manner.  Seating can be tricky, so have one order and another stalk tables! :)  You can park behind the place and walk through the back door....little FYI.|1
I love this place! Everything about it! The great food, the grocery section, the cramped seating (it gives character). It all goes together perfectly. Haven't found one bad thing yet:)|1
probably my favorite restaurant :)|1
I LOVE THIS PLACE! It's so nice to be able to eat here whenever it's chilly outside. Actually, allow me to be honest, I probably would eat here everyday but I settle for 1-2 times a week.  I get my Pho with extra meatballs and no onions and they make it perfect for me each time!!! The folks are awesome and no matter how busy it is everything come out SUPER fast! You know a girl loves to eat in a timely manner with my hectic schedule!  The Springrolls, the crab puffs the chicken fried rice all amazing too! For a good time time and warm feeling after a FANTASTIC meal this is the best come winter or AZ summer time:)|1
Sam, Sven, and all the vendors here make the market special.|1
This place pushes out some delicious food, Red chile burro with rice and beans is better than any I've had, and their Nachos are soooo freaking cheesey and good you'll want to order both for one sitting. Unfortunately only outside seating but cool art work on the building to enjoy while eating and don't be discouraged by there greedy practice of charging for extra hot sauce. But of all things to remember make sure you bring cash the place can't afford a card processing machine which is a good thing other wise I'd be there too often and a fat face looks weird on me|1
So I knew ahead of time about the wait. So we got there at 3:30 and waited for an hour and a half until they opened. But we were able to be seated as soon as they opened.  Let me just say that I've never had anything even close to the kind of pizza that we got. It's outstanding!   I highly recommend the caprese salad, antipasto and the rosa pizza. Though I'm pretty sure that it's all amazing, no matter what you get.|1
"This place confirms why ""hole in the wall"" places are the best places to get food. Its virtually impossible to find the place but once you smell the aroma of home-cooked Mexican food, you know that you're there. Usually there is a long line; however, their service is quick. With the combination of their swift service and decadently savory food, Rito's is a staple Mexican food stand that everyone has to visit when in Phoenix. I always have a green chilli burrito and haven't quite ventured out to other things on their menu, but I have never heard anything less than positive about what they have to offer."|1
"Went back to True Foods ( i have been doing this a lot since my first trip) with my mom for dinner last week. It was amazing as always however this time was different. I tried a new menu item, the Bison burger ( i highly reccomend this) it was so tastey and very light for a burger. OMG! I want to say that this time was different because we had THE BEST SERVICE EVER! Our server Marcus was amazing. He was very informative, helpful, polite and everything you would expect from a server and then some. LOVE THIS CAT. Just thought I would give credit where it is due. Too many times you read about the negatives on service and not so often the positives. I work in a restaurant and know it's important for employers to know who their ""stars"" are. MARCUS is your star. A bright, and shiney star. lol  Loves: Shitaki mushroom lettuce cups, Ahi sliders, Spaghetti Squash, Kale Salad, Raviolli, Green Tea, Coffe (black) and I always have to have the Banana chocolate Tart. Definitely ."|1
I have to tell you....  I had their Jerk Chicken Plate the other night, and it was yuuuuummmmmyyy! You gotta try it!|1
I am giving Ajo Al's on Shae five stars because I've been there regularly for about two years and it's always good. Now let me point out two issues: I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, and I only get the Tacos Del Mar or Ono Fajitas which are versions of the same thing. The chips are fresh made and great as are the salsa and hot salsa (more peppery and hot). For appetizers the Chili Con Queso Dip and Nachos are good sized and tasty. For a friend and I this location is somewhat out of the way but we still go regularly. Try it.  Detail:  Like I said I'm not exactly a fan of Mexican food. I like the Americanized fast-ish food chains: Qdoba, Chipotle even Baja Fresh. I've eaten at actual Mexican restaurants in Mexico and had home cooked Mexican fish tacos and tamales. It's growing on me but these are not tastes I grew up with.  I have a friend who loves Ajo Al's, she lived next to it or something. So I pretty much got dragged there about two years ago and I liked it right away. Like I said, I've only really eaten the fish tacos but they're the best I've had. The fish is good, the sides are good, idk what chipotle cream is but it's good, good service, the chip lady is nice, all the wait staff have been good.  It's typically not crowded but sometimes your go there and the place is close to full. I've never waited to be seated though. I've never tried the bar area. The water seams better than tap water...a dumb observation but I usually drink water rather than soda so I mention that. They give you a pitcher of water on seating and refill if needed. The chips and salsa are endless and excellent. Service is always good.  Two friends typically get the Pollo Con Queso and swear it's the best ever. I've had it as left-overs and it's good but not really my thing.  This is the only Ajo Al's I've been to...no comment on the rest of this chain.|1
Staff was quick and efficient. Food was delicious.|1
Having worked in the Scottsdale Airpark area going on 9 years or so, I've eaten lunch just about everywhere. There are plenty of good places, but not many ethnic places... Indian Paradise has the distinction of being both great and ethnic. I've only ever eaten there for the lunch buffet, and it is AMAZING!  I keep thinking that I'm gonna be disappointed, eventually... But every single time I have dined here I have come away extremely satisfied and in dire need of a nap. I keep asking myself, how can it be so good? Is it cocaine? Cocaine in the food?! Is it?!  They have different buffet items on different days, but the the mainstay curry chicken remains a favorite of mine. On Friday there is a mushroom dish that I dream about... and on Thursday they have stuffed jalapenos that are a little hot but oh so gooooooood!  Be sure to save some room for the rice pudding, 'cause it's delicious.|1
"This is a great little hidden gem! From the outside, it looks like just a dive but the inside is surprisingly nice.   The food here is great and they are willing to make things to your taste when it comes to ingredients and spice level.   The waitstaff are also very friendly. They came by while we were eating just to make sure we were happy with everything even though this is an ""order at the counter"" place.  Another little bonus is that they have a drink station where guests can help themselves to free refills which definitely comes in handy in Phoenix!"|1
Ice Ice Baby... Ice Ice Baby...  All right stop collaborate and listen; Ice Now is here and it's got my attention  Make some drinks - not warm but frosty; And believe me when I say they are not costly Will it ever melt? yo I don't know. Give them a call and they'll show To the extreme I yelp like a sandal; Ice your drinks and get lit like a candle ... Ice ice baby  PS - not sure where the sandal line came in but writing a review in lyric form is a challenge!  This is the best I can do for now...  Need ice for an event?  Call Ice Now! They offer free delivery and their pricing is surprisingly cheap.  And good luck getting the Ice Ice Baby lyrics out of your head... (sorry)!|1
Attended the Table 12 Lunch & Learn event with guest Chef Mel Mecinas and was truly blown away.  I have previously eaten off of the house menu, so was expecting just as spectacular presentation as Chef Beau Macmillan presents - I was not disappointed.  Our party started the night at Jade, which I have written a review for previously.  Great place, wont go into much detail there.  The meal started with with an entree of a rare tuna, bacon, asparagus, and hollandaise sauce.  Second course was Korean short ribs, brussel spouts, and lotus root kimchi.  For dessert, twas a bourbon banana creme with carmel popcorn and candied walnuts.  The meal could not have been more amazing, and the service was just as good.  Have already booked the event on Aug 18.|1
SIMPLY AMAZING!  WE LOVE IT!  My hubby and I stopped in one day after deciding NOT to go to NYPD.  They were next door, and we thought lets try something new. We have been there 3 times since. You sit, and the food comes by and you just grab what you want off the rotating bar. ITS GREAT! Especially if you can not decide what you want until seeing it. We ate like King and Queen for $20.00.  They have simple pricing, and it is affordable for a date or family.|1
I'm very happy that I called Enterprise Pools.  They have friendly service and worked with my schedule when I asked for an estimate.  Mike was knowledgeable and quickly determined what the problem was and even told me how I could fix it.  He offered service at a reasonable price and never tried to sell me something for the sake of sales.  It was definitely a relief to find an honest business man after dealing with sub par service from Leslie's for such a long time!|1
Pita Jungle is a staple favorite of mine and my boyfriend's. Healthy, hearty and great service. It's too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up (as have other restaurants) but I'll still patronize this place. Read as: some things went up in price almost two dollars, but you can still have a meal and a drink for around $10, more or less, depending on what you order. I definitely like this place over the new one across MCC on Southern - there's something about being by the lake that makes it special. Even if there are stinky ducks there from time to time. ;)  Ooh - and the gambas con ajos is my favorite appetizer! :)|1
Stop everything you're doing and go get one of their brownies, warmed up, with an ice cold glass of milk. I'll never be the same.|1
I love the Valley Ho! It's a beautiful property with great rooms, a fantastic pool, an excellent restaurant -- Trader Vic's and a really nice spa. Be sure to stay in the newly re-modeled Loft Suite. It's two stories and it's fantastic! If I was to take a stay-cation, I would be sure to stay at the Valley Ho! And for all you out-of-towner's who want to stay in Old Town Scottsdale and be close to great shopping, restaurants, and nightclubs, the Valley Ho should be at the top of your list!|1
I was introduced to SanTan Brewery two years ago on a very cold, winter evening. My cousin knew I would instantly fall in love with this place, simply because I just love fine craft beer.  He was surely right because I visit SanTan three times a week because I simply cannot get enough of their beer selection. It's like an adventure every time I go. The staff is fantastic not because they're very nice and friendly, but they have the same passion and enthusiasm for fine craft as I do, so relating to them in that respect makes the experience fantastic.  I normally do not engage in writing reviews on websites like this, simply because I personally tell the management team my best regards but I will for this because people really do need to experience the joys this brewery has to offer.   SanTan is the new level of drinking and dining experience. It's relaxed, fun mature environment and you can start a conversation with anyone there. Enough reading this review, go try it out yourself.|1
"This is a Mom & Pop Mexican restaurant on Tempe's east end, the food is awesome and of the good ""Homemade"" quality. Known the family for almost 30 yrs now."|1
"I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place. It goes to show you, you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.  In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small ""Here's The Beef"" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11"" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!  We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues."|1
I've been Dr. Castilla's office for 7 years.  Her office has relocated and her practice has grown over the years and for good reason.  She is a Dr. that treats you as a person and takes her time to honestly answer your questions.  She makes eye contact with you and I couldn't ask for anything more.  Just remember, it is a large practice and the staff is sometimes questionable.  But, she's worth the wait!   Now that we've relocated, I hate to give up Dr. Castilla.  She's irreplaceable!|1
"had a ""cap steak"" for the first time. Best steak i have ever had.  Would recommend to anyone."|1
So yummy!! My favorite Mexican place!! Love the chips, salsa, and bean dip. The extra spicy green salsa is so good too. We are regulars here.|1
Phenom.  The food is always fresh and well seasoned. A good selection of Tequila.  Every meal that I've had has been just fantastic. The carnitas and the fish taco's are very well prepared. It's fresh, the beans are fresh as is the rice.  It averages about $10 a plate but worth it. This is how really good Mexican should be.  The salsa bar is excellent: you have about 5 different types of salsa from which to choose. All freshly made.  I can't say enough about the flavoring of the meats and fish.  Decor is a somewhat minimalist/modern, probably to attract a happy hour crowd. They have TV's for your viewing pleasure.  Service is friendly and quick.  I've only been to the Chandler location but will start going to the one in Scottsdale.  Good food. You won't be disappointed.|1
Fantastic Happy Hour 3-6pm! Half price appetizers and good drink prices. I like their Sushi and Garlic Noodles.  And pretty much everything I've had there is good. I had a Peppercorn Steak about 2 weeks ago and it was amazing. It's right next to the movies so it's a good place to meetup too.|1
"There are so many good things for me to say about this place that I have no idea where to begin.  The ambiance is so amazing no matter what time of day you go. The small, intimate bar area (with quite a few pretty men!) is lovely on a sunny day out, while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date. The menu is so great, carrying lots of new age food items (quinoa, black forbidden rice bowl, kale,and lots of dishes carrying local food items). It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan menu items. One time I tried to order the wood-fired vegetables and the waiter *swore* it was vegan. As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it, and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what ""vegan"" meant. We ended up having to call a manager over.  The cocktail menu is so interesting it's hard to decide what to get. My favorite is the Dark and Stormy, which has ginger beer. *the BEST* cocktail around IMO. Do not pass up dessert. The bananas foster is amazing! Not traditional but good in and of its own."|1
Divine,  the Carne Asada was so tasty,  flavorful and tender.  Everything we enjoyed tasted fresh and authentic. The guacamole was knock you socks off, traditional and limey, (I took my extra home and enjoyed the next day).  I liked what the previous reviewer who said also that the beans and rice are not an afterthought here, they are also amazingly well executed.  I am eager to get back an try the Chicken and Barbacoa as well as the roasted green chile cheese dip.   If your in the area of 44th Street and Thomas, forgo the big chain of Chipotle and show this lovey Phoenix gem some love, your taste buds will not be disappointed.|1
What a great property. Only had been to the bar years ago after the renovation, finally had a chance to stay in a Studio room this weekend. I was over the moon after this stay.  I was looking for a nice weekend treat for me an my girlfriend. Vegas was tempting, but the drive eats up time I just don't have, and I don't gamble. For about the same as a discounted room at the Mirage and fuel expenses, I was able to get a gorgeous suite at the Valley Ho.   Very fast, friendly check in. No lines, no bullshit resort fees and a personable guy behind the counter. Never get that in Vegas...  Decor is startlingly unique. In a sea of cookie cutter mega resorts, a nice spin on hip, 1960's American style is a welcome change of pace. The details are like no other hotel I've stayed in, and the grounds are well landscaped and immaculate. It's quite humbling to think this place has seen patrons for 55 years.   Studio Suite is super cool. Clean, good sized and hip. Tub in the center of the room was very, very cool, and was very useful. Good bed, good linens, great shower. Dug the little patio and the large sliding glass doors were awesome on a cool fall morning. Good colors, too. Only a few gripes; the bed side lamps are unusable with their super bright, nasty color temperature CFLs. Thankfully, there's lots of other mood lighting available. Also, the ceiling was starting to look a bit worse for wear, with some sagging at the joints and some water stains. Flat roofs always leak, though. In room music system ala Hard Rock would be a great addition, since TV is for the birds.    Location is unbeatable. A short walk to anything in Old Town, Fashion Square, nightclub block, etc. But far enough away from the bars that it's quiet at night. Found a great new restaurant (The House) on Main St. that I would have never stumbled across otherwise. Probably the only worthwhile, walkable district in Phoenix that never disappoints, and this hotel takes advantage of it.   I will absolutely be back. Makes a great in town escape. Just wish I would have tried it out sooner!|1
Great food and drink. The traditional margaritas are the best. Sara was our server and she was very knowledgable about the menu and was quite entertaining. The cheese enchilada that I had was one of the best ever.|1
Love this place! I think this is probably the best Chinese buffet out here! They serve quality gourmet food. And they have a full bar too. Place is clean and service is great. Would go back anytime!|1
It is sometimes difficult to start out busy and maintain great standards from the beginning.  The Parlor seems to be nailing it.  Hip yet comfortable decor.   Very creative design, and I loved he subtle yet present homage to the former tenant Salon de Venus.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm and sincere smile, and that same enthusiasm was felt by every single staff member we encountered.   Ah the food!  Fresh ingredients, a great light pizza crust, and an original beet salad all  had us raving.   The only minor picky foody issue was the Nectarine Crustada for dessert was luke warm at best, would have liked a nice hot dish to melt that delicious ice cream.    But why nit pic?  This place is a big hit, from the moment you walk past the fresh herb and vegetable garden,  to the fantastic staff and the  savory food, this place is already on my regular rotation.|1
"This is one of my new favorites places to bring people who are from out of town. It's something different that I think real ""Foodies"" will enjoy. Although the restaurant itself is dark and cramped, it's worth going to over and over again.   I ordered the Shepherd's Pie Pasty, it was very filling and delicious. Although I had to wait 20 minutes for it, it was worth waiting for a fresh out of the oven pasty. But if you're ever in a rush, a good thing about this place, is that you can call ahead and request for them to start cooking your pasty so that it is ready to be served once you arrive."|1
Owner Daniel M. is one of my most favorite restaurateurs in Phoenix. His stamina and passion for the business of serving fine cuisine is a rare find. Daniel is from South America but you wouldn't know it; his knowledge of the secret kitchens of Tuscany, Umbria and Amalfi is uncanny. I know this because I traveled with him and his chef one year on their odyssey through Italy.  Daniel takes special pride in personally choosing a very select few bottles of wine to fit any budget. OK, it's not Etienne's Different Point of View's list of 4000, but know that any choice you make is going to be a good one. If you're not sure, just ask for Daniel and tell him what you have in mind -- likely he has (with a wink) a special bottle in the back.  When we traveled through the Italian countryside I was constantly astonished by the warm greetings and special invitations we had from local proprietors who shared with us exquisite homemade wines and dishes made with pride from the finest vegetables and livestock. We frequently stayed long past closing with the owners and into the night sampling rare port and grappa. At one restaurant in Orvieto the owner took us deep into the dank recesses of the wine cellar for a special sampling  of cheese and wine. Talk about knowing people? One afternoon while drinking our 5th bottle of wine, who walks by but Jan D'Atri! Wow. (That's another review.) And speaking of reviewers, I also ran into Phoenix Magazine's Nikki Buchanan (also extremely nice).  When Daniel first opened in this location with that little stone oven in the corner, it was a pizzeria and guests could belly up to long tables in a casual environment that was made easy by his banter with the heavy Italian accented waitress (name?) who made a comeback some years later. For quite some time the restaurant was Il Forno; that is until corporate giant Il Fornaio entered the fray and sued him to change the name. After much rigmarole he changed to aqua e sale -- and notice Il Fornaio has since closed its doors? LOL. Again after much hoopla, he made it Daniel's. The current wood-paneled decor makes me think of a city club in San Fran or London. Very posh, yet understated. Selections of sculpture and art from his travels dot the restaurant's three small dining rooms.  The menu is a very difficult one. I say that because it has all of your favorites and it is difficult to make your final selection. Great for steak, ravioli, the best carpaccio in the city, best buffala mozzarella, mmm.... I could go on and on. So does the menu, page after page.  Some might call the preparations simplistic. This is the Tuscan way. Simple ingredients and simple preparation. Let the ingredients make their own magic. Grilled rack of lamb is not drowned in some Smucker's lime jelly, but gently brushed with rosemary and garlic, tickled with salt and pepper and finished with a squeeze spray of lemon.  Unfortunately the artful one-of-a-kind plates and bowls handmade in Vietri chipped at the edges over the years and the health department made him throw them away -- UGH!! -- they were a beautiful motivation to make you lick your plate clean to see the painted pictures beneath your scrumptious dinner. Not that you needed an excuse to dab every last bit of sauce with the wonderful mini loaves of bread cooked right there in the hearth that started it all.  Daniel himself is a wonderful host. He loves to give his guests a wonderful experience. There are many choices for Italian food in Phoenix. Most of it is just American Italian. Daniel's is a unique touch of the simple yet elegant. Enjoy.  P.S. [post edit] OMG. How could I forget the Tiramisu? It's a generous portion, so you can share with your guest, but after your first bite you may not want to. Light and airy, yet fantastically flavorful, the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again. I'm not going to tell you the secret ingredient. You'll have to ask Daniel.|1
good place to kill an evening. I used to spend my time here many moons ago. good coffee at good prices.|1
Best breakfast in the valley. Dinner sucks. Well, let's clarify a bit here. We've ordered blueberry pancakes, stuffed french toast, muffins, and a few other b-fast items. They were all stupidly good. For dinner, we've tried a couple dishes such as the recommended jumbalaya - SUCKS! Stay away from that canned garbage. Back to breakfast...dang, that's incredible!|1
I can't believe no one has talked about Pasta Tuesday. Definitely the best time to go but make sure you get there early because the pasta literally runs out. It is that good. They have this guy (Guido) come every Tuesday and he starts making hand made pasta early in the morning. He picks 2 unique dishes. It was one of the best pasta I have EVER tasted. I crave it all the time. I had a fettucini noodle in a alfredo creme sauce with herbs and pine nuts on top. I can't even describe the taste (wow what a good food critic i am). You just have to go check it out. I am going TONIGHT!|1
I cannot recommend Phoenix Knife House enough.    There are very few places where you can go and physically put your hands on so many different Japanese knives, which is obviously key in any knife purchase.  If you've ever spent hours in the kitchen doing prep and chopping, blisters are a very real possibility if the knife doesn't fit.  I've discovered over the last several years of cooking at home that I prefer a lighter and bolster-less knife for high speed chopping, which ultimately led me back to PKH for a purchase.  Last year I purchased a Fujiwara 150mm petty for less than $60, and it's been a great knife; my girlfriend also likes it because it's light and maneuverable.  She bought me a Misono UX10 for my birthday, which will ultimately replace my Henckels for most uses.  Bottom line, go in, tap into Eytan's knowledge of the knives (and care and maintenance), and get better tools for the job.  It's well worth it.  I bring all my kitchen knives here to get sharpened, either by hand or on the grinding wheel.  Today I had four knives sharpened, three on the wheel, one by hand, and two with tip damage.  Total cost = $13.    Bonus: purchases are tax free.  Highly recommended.|1
After reading the great reviews and getting plenty of recommendations to try Fez, I had the awesome opportunity to test it out last night at my first Yelp event and I am in love!  From the bright decor to the delicious food to the amazing service (I mean everyone who works there actually looks like they enjoy their job and are having a good time!) this place is 5 star.    I love the cozy lounge feel and could easily see myself enjoying several hours of delicious cocktails and conversation with friends.  This would be a great spot for dinner, drinks, or even an event (another Yelp event please!).  Highlights: Tasty drink menu Fabulous wicker tables and trendy IKEAish style Great part of town Sexy servers...dang  Impress someone: Take them to FEZ!|1
Only 10 min away from walking distant. This is really really really good, also really really really bad.  I am almost finished with trying each soynami.... So far and not a fan of the one with banana. YET EVERYTHING is.... just... just good. Place on top of a Swiss Alp let me sing, dance, and exclaiming goodness oozing.   Also i can eat one and not feel lik I am creating havoc for my metabolism to compensate.  RL:  NOTE: Oddly takes an unusually amount of time to get into my hands. 10min? Worth the wait, worth the walk, worth the extra chocolate ;)|1
"I found this place via Google while in town for business. It's tucked away in a non-descript strip mall next to a Salvation Army.  I've had dinner and lunch here, both times were good. For dinner, I had the special turkey sandwich with fries (fries weren't pipping hot when they were served, but still good); for the lunch visit, I had the original ""g"" spicy po-boy and chose the curry pasta salad as a side - tasty!  Service was friendly and efficient. _______________  Update:  12/10/07 - What's the first thing I do when I arrive in Phoenix? Punch in 2240 N. Scottsdale Road in my GPS and head to Green! This time around I had Thee Argentine Po-Boy with fried - Mock steak fried with onions and peppers, vegan mayo and a spicy sauce. I couldn't get enough! Very delicious  12/11/07 - After having a veggie burger and fries for lunch at a Hard Rock Cafe, I thought I'd balance it out by having something healthy for dinner - I ordered the Diablo Rice bowl with chicken and brown rice. The description looked good: veggies in a spicy sauce - but it was a little too salty for my taste and didn't finish it. Oh well, can't win them all.  12/12/07 - I was working close by, so decided to run in for lunch. I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich with a side of tahini coleslaw. It was a little bit messy to eat by hand, with the tomato sauce and soy mozzarella oozing everywhere - still good nonetheless. The coleslaw was a nice compliment to the sandwich.  12/14/07 - I'll miss you Green!"|1
I love this place!!! The first time I went I fell in love with their fries and their secret sauce. They have those great crinkle fries and they are made to order so they come out super crispy and hot. They alone can stand on their own but I have to have the sauce. It has to be a mixture of ketchup, mayo probably some chili powder and some other stuff that I can't figure out. No matter how many times I try to do it at home I never get it. Once before I got the Italian Beef but being my first time I didn't know that you could get it wet... Duh... and ended up eating a warm roast beef sandwich that was a bit on the dry side. After reading the Yelp reviews I realized that you can add all kinds of stuff to it. I think that the girl at the register should've at least informed me that I had options. The staff (girls at the register) weren't all too friendly which makes for a less than pleasant experience right from the start. Hopefully they aren't there anymore. Forward to today I decided to give it another shot and I am so glad I did. The owner is a really cool guy and is always super nice when I come in. He asked me all the questions about how I wanted the sandwich and put the dip in a to go cup for me so I wouldn't have a mush sandwich when I got home. I added provolone and hot giardiniera which absolutely made the sandwich. I didn't get to finish it because my other half smelled it and swooped in and polished it off and loved it too. Good thing I got the fries! I would highly recommend this place. If you do have the Italian Beef you should try to eat it there instead of taking it home. If you get embarrassed easily or worry about food all over your hands and face then don't eat this infront of other people. I think it once you eat it you won't even care if it gets in your hair. So I say get over it and get your butt down to Lobbys and eat til you explode!|1
I've been coming to Yusefs now for awhile to get gyro meat to go, along with their fresh feta, pitas and cucumber yogurt. BEST I'VE HAD! Finally I was able to eat there as they have a kitchen and OMG, it was delis and the prices are fabulous. I ordered the lentil soup and holy cow, it was UNREAL! I got the gyro plate with gyro meat and fresh rice (basmati?) and it was fabulous. Gyro Greek salad was amazing too. I love coming here because the owner is nice and very sweet!!!!!  I recommend you try this little gem!! It's worth the drive!|1
I absolutely love Chompies! It's the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix. They have a very large and extensive menu and everything I've ordered has been really good.  They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies, red velvet cake, enormous éclairs, napoleons, and New York style cheese cake.  I'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich, although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs. Food. The sliders were really good, unlike any slider I have ever had. The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor, very tasty. I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well.   Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler, I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitresses.  Chompies is the best!|1
Nooooooooo!  Curse the the gods of all that is delicious, for Huauchinango is now CLOSED.  Replaced by some generic grill that offered us some nachos and quesadillas, thanks for that.  So not only did you replace a great eatery, but you also had to throw in a little bit of extra salt in the wound.  So, I don't think I'll be giving my business to the devil grill anytime soon.  Huauchinango, you shall now only be a distant whiff of habanero al pastor memory. You shall be missed.|1
"I am not usually a fan of botanical gardens. They seem too precious, too ""perfect"" to be of much interest. And, let's face it, flowers and plants are beautiful things, but when you pay to look at them in neat rows, something is lost.  That said, Desert Botanical Gardens is an exception to this garden cynic. Many of these cacti look like they are from another planet, like something you would see in a sci-fi film and say, ""wow, it's too bad those crazy plants don't exist."" They sprawl out on the ground, weaving and turning every which way, or compose huge bizarre formations high off the ground. I never knew such bizarre life forms existed, or that some cacti look like trees.  The gardens are full of windy paths where one is also likely to find a family of quail, lizards, or a jackrabbit or two. Various species of bird can be seen here as well, especially at dusk. I especially love watching the birds fly in and out of nests they've made in the upper arms of cacti.  This place never grows old. It's a great introduction to the desert for people from out of town, and because the cacti have been collected from around the world, a cool botany lesson for us all here."|1
Love this place!  Went for a stay-cation with the girls for a spa day and stayed the night.  I can't wait to go back!  You are in the city but feels miles away!  The spa is amazing!  Wonderful adults only pool with great refreshing food and drinks.  Then our rooms were clean and comfortable.  Dinner at Kai was nothing short of superb, and breakfast the next morning on the patio over looking the golf course and pool area was also very good.  Overall a wonderful night away.|1
Love, love, love! Service is always fabulous and every dish has been perfect. The local cheese plate and AZ wine selections are amazing. I think between the 5 of us we have had everything on the menu, and it was all delicious. This is my fave place in the country right now. Can't wait to go back over the holidays!|1
Great place for brunch or to relax with a coffee. Their hot chocolate is amazing.|1
So yummy!  I got the low calorie yogurt with all kinds of yummy fruit in it & didn't even feel guilty.  Such a fun place to go with friends or as a nice dessert after dinner. I can't wait to go again!|1
Who dosen't like Cosco, I love this place. The pizza is cheap and good.|1
Took Travis here for one of our first dates and just LOVE Cibo.  It's situated in a home from 1913 and has colored lights wrapped all around the trees.  You can either sit inside or on the gorgeous patio.  Brick oven pizza and cheese plates offered here and it's definitely a place for a cool date.|1
This has become one of my favorites.  They're friendly,  reasonably priced and the food is always delicious.  My husband and I have tried a number of their items, but my personal favorites are the BBQ pork appetizer, house fried rice, the mushu and lemon chicken.  My husband also loves the house fried rice, the mushu and the orange chicken.  One of the things that is so wonderful about this place is, the food isn't heavy.  The sauces are light and fresh tasting.  Plus, I'm lucky enough to be in their delivery zone.  When I get delivery, the food is still hot and tastes like it was made just a few minutes earlier.  I have yet to be disappointed by anything I've ordered here, and to me, that's a sign of a good restaurant.|1
Fantastic venue! The bartenders are nice- the drinks are excellent. The lounge is an amazing place to hang out (best downtown spot?!) even if you aren't going to the show! Cool free shows in the lounge! Now let's talk about the main reason you would go there- THE MUSIC! And the venue itself is awesome! The sound is great! The ROOM IS GREAT! It was designed by someone who knew what concert goers want- an intimate experience with fantastic sound. And so if you have the curse of ALWAYS standing behind the TALLEST DUDES EVER at shows- you can now take advantage of the bleacher seating in the back of the room or benches on the side. THERE IS NOT A BAD SEAT IN THE HOUSE! What is left to say ? GET THERE!|1
I go there often. Love the food. Love the atmosphere. Great beers & usually great service|1
T. Cook's continues to be my go-to spot... with or without my fiance.  It's like my home away from home.  I feel comfortable going in for a drink or a bite to eat any night of the week.  Let me be clear about one thing, however - I always sit at the bar!  In addition to the regular menu items, the burger at T. Cooks is consistently amazing. This sizable delight is carnivore candy for the soul. Ten ounces of tenderloin burger with white cheddar cheese, bacon and Guiness tempura onion rings on a ciabatta bun with a grain mustard aioli. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now.  Anyone up for a burger?|1
Even though the new place is limited on seating the food more than makes up the difference.    I took my wife and kids for lunch.  We had some pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches, fresh made slaw, and mac and cheese made from scratch like mom used to make.  The kids gobbled up the mac and cheese.  The meat was definately cooked with love.    Grady's makes their own signature sauce in several varieties.  They sell bottles of it as well.  I liked mixing the Hot with the Super Hot to make that pork melt that much better in my mouth.  I also noticed they do catering.  I've had events catered by some other BBQ joints before, but this food is much better quality and I think I can woo the crowds with Grady's BBQ.  I fully recommend stopping into my new favorite barbeque place in Arizona.  Thanks for making good food Grady.  We all enjoyed it and writing this made me hungry for more.|1
"So far, I have been to Lola twice (a Saturday night and Monday morning). Saturday night was very quiet compared to the super busy Monday morning. Free Wi-Fi, coffee, baked goods, and awesome location...you can't beat it. The morning we went, we had a Monterrey Jack scone that was really good. I laughed when I got my latte in a ""So I Married an Axe Murder""-esque cup. We sat along the high tables facing Central Ave and I really enjoyed surfing the internet and looking out towards Central. There are various types of seating as well as some outdoor tables. I really loved this place but worry that it will be one of those places that will be so popular, you'll never get to sit there. That is why I stopped going to Lux because it eventually got so crowded all of the time. My favorite part of Lola coffee is being right on Central and watching traffic and the light rail go past. Love it, love it."|1
This review is mainly for the bar and a few light (ok not light, but small) snacks.    Met with a couple people during their soft opening and there was absolutely nothing soft about it.  I got there a few minutes early and posted up at the bar to grab a Manhattan.  This drink is usually my boozometer when I am trying a place first.  Ok, we've got something here, this drink is tasty.  Started talking to the bartenders and got a really comfortable feeling from them.  When was the last time that you sit down to the bar and  they ask your name, tell you their's, and then shake your hand?    After the manhattan the rest of the group showed.  The bar was a little too busy to fit the three of us so I took my second drink, sazerac, to the table.  Sazerac was tasty as well.  Rest of the table ordered some drinks and nothing negative to be said anywhere.  We each had around 4 or 5 drinks and every last one of them was delicious.    We were comped a few bar snack and all were delicious but the stand out was the warm nuts. (twss)  Mixed nuts warmed with Herbs De Provence and a little bit of chili flake I believe.  Soooooo good.    As for the style of the place it is fantastic.  Feels cool but not cliche.  The Palomar staff did a fantastic job of designing this space.  As of now this is the one place in City Scape that is worth while.|1
My family has been going to Dr. Brittan for 10 years.  He is an excellent dentist and can handle any situation you can throw at him.|1
Great theatre! Super clean and nice sound in all theatres. Only caveat: I can read the prices on the beverage and popcorn menu sign thing, so when I order a medium, I want a medium, I can see that for 50 cents more I can get the large. I just don't want to pee myself when I get caught up in a good flick. But thanks anyway.|1
I stayed at the Motel right across the street from this restaurant when I stayed in Gila Bend. I had been driving all day through the hot desert and really wanted to kick back with a cold beer and some good food. Little Italy did not disappoint!! I got a large pizza that was AMAZING!! Plus the service was great too. Fast and friendly.|1
As far as sports bars go, this one can't be beat. You won't find one in the East Valley with better food, beer selection, happy hour, or a friendlier staff. This is hands-down one of my favorite places in all of Ahwatukee and the surrounding areas.  I've been here bunches of times, and the only one bad experience I had (overcooked burger) they took care of the situation above and beyond.  I can't say it enough: go, eat, drink, see for yourself: Public House is the best around.|1
i love this place and eat there every time I'm in the area.  Pizza, pasta, appetizers all fantastic.  Plan to spend some time waiting for a table.  We always have fun just eating at the bar.  Yumm|1
I have used Sandella's on three different occasions for catering lunches to business offices.  Jeff ( owner) does a fantastic job at not only running a great business but also with the quality of food he prepares for customers and excellent customer service and catering as well.  My offices that I bring lunch to love this food fare. It is a healthy alternative that many of my offices are craving after having so many lunches brought to them that weigh them down and make them feel like going to sleep after lunch. As a part of our healthcare community this food is something I feel confident about bringing to my colleges and offices that I visit. It taste great, it is made with only the best ingredient personally selected by Jeff and it is best of all , healthy.|1
Aiello's is my favorite Italian spot in the Valley.  In fact, I day dream about the Mushroom Ravioli Special - you can taste the love in this dish.   Great ambiance and a wonderful experience.  The staff are always attentive and professional.  The Owner makes a stop or two to make sure you're having a good time and they even let chance decide who pays for dinner, you or the house!  Helpful hint:  Try no to get stuffed on the tasty bread and hot peppers served before the entree, you're going to want to finish it!|1
"Let's start by disclosing that I grew up in New Orleans, went to school in Lafayette (home of the Ragin Cajuns), and REALLY know good New Orleans/cajun food. I grew up eating great po-boys, gumbo, red beans, and wouldn't consider eating any of these if not well prepared. That said, I can truly say that Jennifer and the Flavors of Louisiana gang make cajun food as good as any you'll find in New Orleans--SERIOUSLY. The po-boys are spot on (though the bread could be a little crustier) and the chicken & andouille gumbo is even better than mine--and, I assure you, that's DAMN GOOD. Frankly, I've never had better. The only thing that is not ""as good as it gets"" is the red beans and rice. They're good, but not quite the creamy ""Washday Monday"" staple that I grew up on. My cajun grandmother has Jennifer beat on that one, but not by much.   But, if you want a special treat and want to taste something that kills all, get a sausage po-boy. Hot sausage or smoked sausage po-boys are a New Orleans staple and my favorite po-boys of all. But, Jennifer blows them all away with her home-made andouille. Simply put, I've never had better sausage--ever. It's the reason her gumbo is soooo good and her po-boy the best ever.  I've eaten at Flavors many times, even though I live across town. Every time I go, I eat like a pig and bring some home to eat later. I have no affiliation with the restaurant, but wanted to post this as a review from someone who really knows New Orleans food and as a thank you to Jennifer and her crew for giving me a source for the best flavors in the World (not just Louisiana). As a matter of fact, I even overlook the fact that Jennifer is from Baton Rouge, instead of New Orleans or Lafayette and for not having any USL/UL Lafayette paraphernalia on the LSU/Saints wall. At least that is, so long as she keeps her promise to open another restaurant on the east side of town--that is, a lot closer to where I live.  If you want the ONLY good cajun food in Phoenix, treat yourself to Flavors of Louisiana. For me, it's just like a visit to any of my favorite po-boy shops in the old neighborhoods. It really is that good."|1
Gotta love a place open late in Phoenix. 2.50 petite martinis after midnite; yes please!|1
Being English and missing a lot of the things we can't get over here we were delighted to have found this place.  I have not tried all of the pasties and have stuck to the traditional ones that we get at home, i.e, cheese and onion and cornish and they are very good!!  I sent my husband there to buy their half baked ones so we could freeze them and have whenever we get the craving and I ended up ordering $80 worth without any regrets.  Needless to say my freezer is full of pasties and I even have a couple of ones I have not tasted before, so looking forward to trying those.  Have not eaten in the place either but quite frankly the food is that good I don't it would matter what it's like inside.  Also just noticed this is the Mesa shop we have only bought from the newly opened on in Tempe.|1
Fuego Bistro has quickly become one of my wife and I's favorite restaurants!  We went with a large group the first time and they were great about us having 7, including two smaller children.  Last night my wife and I went back for a date night and had the most wonderful time!  Jeff, the owner, is fantastic and always wants to make sure you have a great time.  The sommelier was also great.  He talked to us about the wine, gave us some tips for pairings, and even had us take a sip of wine while chewing our food.  It totally changed the character of both the wine and food.  Speaking of the food, the short ribs are amazing!  The best sides we've had are the creamed corn and the chipotle mashed potatoes, but the maple chili carrots and the cornbread green chili casserole are also very good!  The cocktails are great and the happy hour menu is pretty reasonable.  We will definitely be going to Fuego on a regular basis!!|1
I love the Ranch Market!  The atmosphere is great, the produce prices are very reasonable, and the civiche is excellent! I never go down the center isles, as they appear to be filled with typical grocery store packaged foods  What makes Ranch Market special are the fantastic offerings all around the center isles.    Here is my advice:  First, make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink, it's just past the bakery at the front door.  After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert.|1
I'm very new to PHX. I ended up talking to a cop at the airport who told me about Thursday Rockabilly nights at the Blooze. I had to check it out. My friend and I walked in and were instantly comfortable, excited, and impressed. The AC was pumping, beer was cold, the music; rockin, and the crowd; refreshing. The bathroom was great!  They don't have food there but they will let you bring in whatever you want. We went there pretty early, around 7:30ish. Unfortunately, because of ridiculously early work on Fri AM, I had to leave once it was starting to get really packed and lively around 10:30/11. I am so glad that I finally checked the place out though. I will definitely frequent The Blooze as often as I can.|1
"Oh my God, Chompie's is the bomb and I'm so happy to have a location so close to my house!  While this location has a steady customer base, I have never had to wait longer then five minutes to be seated, unlike the other location at 92nd Street, Win! Service has always been fantastic. Quick on to seat, quick to get drinks, quick on refills, and delicious food from breakfast to dinner items. As other reviewers have stated, the Jewish sliders are amazing, but I have also enjoyed different wraps and sandwiches. Prices are a little higher, but the food is well worth the money. There is a ""bar area"" with about six stools and two TV's that you are able to see from your tables/booths which usually has ESPN on.   The restaurant itself is all decked out in a NYC theme, well lit, but the acoustics aren't that great so it can get a little noisy. Bathrooms are nice and always clean. Oh, and don't forget to check out their bakery for delicious goodies to take home!"|1
This is a great relaxing spot to stop for breakfast. The food is always amazing and the atmosphere is something that will send you into the right mood to enjoy the rest of your day. I wish there where more spots like this on the civic center park it's such a great location.|1
Great experience at the Phoenician, specifically Il Terrazzo. We normally buy many loaves of bread from them at OTFM (Old Town Farmer's Market). They were absent yesterday so we called in an order & went directly there to pick it up.  Was gorgeous of course & they were as nice as pie.  And the important part is that the bread was fabulous as always (olive walnut, chocolate cherry sourdough, farmer's rye, wheat sourdough, rosemary sourdough, baguette).|1
I'm currently staying at Camelback Inn for 3 days. A pleasant treat after a molar extraction last Friday afternoon. Although I've sworn not to be seen in public with a swollen face, I am truly enjoying this trip. There's a trail just behind this resort and a completely awesome view of the hills. Awesome and I mean it. My hubby is out on his meetings and I'm juggling my work (the luxury of running your own biz, take it anywhere you want do it anytime you want, well not most of the time.. ).  Just had lunch at Hoppins Jack. Excellent service, friendly staff (especially the  handsome young german ;)). Anyway, ordered chicken sandwich with cashews and mandarin orange, delish. My lil' girl was pacified with a vanilla sundae with fruity swirl (raspberry or is it strawberries?) with peaches and berries.. I had a few spoonful, yummy. Kids menu was dirt cheap, fries and 3 pieces of chicken strips or rather crispy chunks  was actully tasty. I still have until tomorrow. Maybe if I have time, I'll head down to the spa for a desert rain loofah. Oh, as for the room, great decor, quite spacious and an outdoor porch with umbrella and seat to lounge around in the sun. Simply love the view. It takes me away from everything. I'm in heavenly desert.Highly recommended.|1
I have had a great experience every time I have been there.  The food is hard to beat and the service was pleasant.    Portions are reasonable, not huge (I'm a big feller), and I was satified every time I ate there.    Very pleasant environment, clean, spacious and calm.|1
Love this place!  Was in phoenix 3 weeks for work.  Ate here 3 times.  The squid salad is amazing!  They also have sushi, bibimbap, and tons of other items.  Must try!|1
"Ok so us 5 hot chix got all dolled up for dinner at City Hall it was about 7 when we arrived on Saturday. The service was top notch from the get go starting with the valet. We were seated by a pleasant hostess in the large main room. Our waiter was an entertaining gentleman, that's one huge plus I have to say about Mastro's is they ""usually"" have seasoned wait staff they really know their product.  They brought us the great basket of warm breads, we ordered bottled water for all and a bottle of some 06 Sauv Blanc that was mighty tasty. It was impossible to have an empty glass this night!  Everyone had fillet's but me of course, I mainly had apps, side's, wine and desert ;) I did try the seared ahi tuna it was ok I wasn't too impressed with it though. Beefsteak tomato & mozz (see pics) very yummy! The creamed corn, sauteed asparagus and mash were all very good!! I couldn't talk anyone into the lobster mash or any caviar boohoo me. =(  Everyone loved their meal!!  My g/f was coming back from the bathroom and missed a step or something somehow she lost her shoe but there was a busser or someone right behind her he picked it up for her and even put it back on for her! Now that is what I call 5 Star Service!!  We had creme brle they served it with various fresh berries and a huge bowl of their fresh made whip cream yum-gasm's were had all around. While Mastro's is not my top choice since I am not a ""Steakhouse kinda girl"" it was all good stuff. They always play some  Michael Bubl and who doesn't just love him!?! It was about 3 bills total and we went home with doggy bags and full tummy's.  P.S.  I had their sweet potato fries they were good but I like the ones at Fez better....just sayin. (O_o)"|1
Update!  Went back last night for dinner, this place is still awesome. I had the Las Vegas Rolls, they were pure deep fried goodness.|1
I could spend hours in this place. In fact, I know I have. There are so many things to look at and it's way more than just books. They have a ton of cards and stationary as well as fun trinkets. If you're into used books, this is the place to go. I've found nearly mint condition vintage books here and they've made the perfect gifts. The people who work here are great as well. They're more than willing to help and offer good recommendations. This is a go to if you're looking for a good read or just want to pop in and explore.|1
I really Love this place! I stopped in for lunch and tried a couple new things.   The Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer (see pics) which is: roasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan, brown butter, sage and crumbled amaretti...OMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share , it's available in two sizes I got the small one. The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch.  I ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect!  My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese! The sausage was really good and for just $5 you can't beat that!|1
As a former Bay Area resident, I have come to love and appreicate all asian food. Generally, I prefer Japanese and Thai over Chinese, however, when it comes to Iron Chef it's my favorite.  The location is perfect as it's only a quick two or three minute drive from my house.  Their food is absolutely delcious and is on par with a high end chinese restaurant.  The quality of the meat, fish and vegetables is just excellent and it's always very consistent.  I generally order the garlic chicken as I love spicy food!  It's a wonderful mix of vegetables and white meat and the sauce is perfect, full of flavor and not at all greasy.  I also like the fact that they offer brown rice as an option and their eggrolls are some of the best I've tasted.    The family meal for $29.95 is an excellent value and is enough food for four or five people.   We ordered it for the two of us and had leftovers for a week!  It includes sweet/sour pork, broccoli beef, orange chicken, chow mein, fried rice, steamed rice, soup and eggrolls.    I sure hope that Iron Chef survives the recession.  I try to eat there as often as I can :)|1
In my opinion, one of the best steakhouses in town.  My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal.  The service is the best just like their steaks.  I recommend the Caesar salad, fillet, creamed spinach, cream corn, garlic and lobster mashed potatoes.  We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here.|1
Amazing place for exceptionally good beer and time with friends! Minimal menu but great collaboration with other local vendors and ordering for delivery at their location is encouraged! Their beer recently passed Four Peaks as my favorite too, not an easy feat! If you're on the fence at all about checking this place out, do yourself a favor and just get yourself there!|1
"Did I ever write about the time I left my ipad here?  Didn't realize for a couple of hours. Heart racing, I called, emailed, hoped it would be recovered. What gracious responses! I got an email early next morning, lots of reassurances, help for when/ how to pick up... Ok so I've reviewed this place before, key words are wonderful creative dishes, a light touch for subtle flavor (right now I'm having a delectable plate of greens, shaved herbs, summer squash wrapped around burrata--- who woulda thought?) but most amazing is the heart warming genuine service of all who care for you here.  Oh.. And there's mightly fine wine on ""tap"". Heh heh.."|1
i hate going to places that i can goto near home, in Phx for the Cubs games.. but my daughter wanted pizza and we saw Z and had to go becuz we know how good it is. I like this one alot better then ours.|1
best. grilled. cheese. and. tomato. soup. ever.|1
Caught Louis CK here last night...   Beautiful theater... absolutely stunning. It was clean, the staff was really nice, and parking was a breeze. The sound was great, the seats were comfy, and I can't really find anything to complain about. Truly one of the most gorgeous theaters I've seen - down to every detail - it's my new favorite... I love it.   L.O.V.E.  If you twisted my arm and forced me to complain - well, in the lobby where they were serving drinks, the line got a little excessive. It wasn't so bad really - but I tried both of the wine they were selling and I kinda hated them. This is more of a bit of advice for you to booze it up before you get there than it is a complaint. I can't recommend this place enough.|1
A burger? With anything I want? FINE....I'll do it.  I need no convincing for a burger, fries and a coke (Thanks Carl's Jr.)   Earleir this afternoon, after a heavy morning of househunting with a couple realtors, I decided to sit my fat backside at a table and eat. And eat well.  I stumbled into the Five Guys at the Fashion Square mall. Not sure how long it's been open. Perhaps it was the grand opening?  It was PACKED! But I digress.  As soon as you get to this location in the food court of the mall, you'll realize that this is not your typical burger joint. They have their own seating separate from the mall-commoners. And their own bathrooms (CLEAN)  You get to the counter and you see a sign telling you about the potatoes they are using for the fries you will be eating.  Ordering your burger isnt a gong show. Fairly easy. All the toppings are listed and all toppings are FREE!  My food was delicious. Got a burger with some of my favorite toppings: onions, tomatoes, etc.   The fries reminded me of an experience I had back in high school, when I held a girls hand for the first time. Soft, perfect and lovely. That's how these fries felt. Ok that sounded weird. Tough.  Oh, I forgot to mention that the soda fountains had COKE ZERO!! EFFING AWESOME! I MEAN THIS IS THE MOST DOPE SODA EVER!!   (I'm really hoping this Kanye yelping phase ends soon, since my reviews make me seem like a bigger Jackass than I seem in person).  Ultimately, I left this place happy, satisfied and I will come back again.  Oh...the answer to the one question in everyone's mind? YES, BETTER THAN IN-N-OUT!|1
I'm so sad I didn't discover the Herb Box sooner. I went for a girl's lunch and was blown away - by the decor, the vibe, the view and the food - and this was during the winter. I can't wait for patio weather because this will become a weekend go-to spot for me. The salads and sandwiches are delicious and the fries and chips - holy moly! They're amazing and you'll get tons of them. The decor is perfectly shabby chic with a traditional twist and I could seriously move in.   If you and your mom and girlfriends love the quaint feel of Arcadia Farms, give Herb Box a whirl. It's got the same feel, but more modern. Love love love it.|1
I was in Bomberos for breakfast this morning, and I was told they now carry Coca Lite!  So much better than Diet Coke - I had no idea I could find it anywhere in the US!  How great is that?  Also, Bomberos is now using MJ Breads and Tammie Co pastries... not too shabby, huh?|1
The food on its own is very good, probably worthy of a four star rating by itself, especially considering how difficult it is to find even passable Italian food in the West Valley.  I bumped Grazie up from four-stars to five-stars because the service is very, very good, ownership is attentive and the atmosphere is very pleasant.  As for the pizza in particular: for a NY native, finding decent pizza in Phoenix is close to impossible. Good thin-crust (Italian-style, as opposed to NY- or Chicago-style), like what they have at Grazie, does happen to be a bit easier to execute, and Grazie does it well. Would I have loved to find a great NY- or Chicago-style slice instead? Sure, but good pizza is good pizza nonetheless.|1
I am in love.  This restaurant does everything a good restaurant should.  Ambiance, service and product were good.  The only disappointment I had was with the hour wait on the Monday we went without a reservation.  My party of four had an excellent time celebrating a birthday.  Two had the short ribs.  Tender to a fault, served with delicious Bar-B-Que sauce and pecan grits.  One had the fillet with a spicy aioli and delicious potatoes. My meal was a huge pork chop, stuffed with Maytag bleu on a ancho bread pudding.    For an app I split the chop salad.  It deserves special mention and I do recommend it, but it is not a sustaining salad, more of a amuse-bouche.  For dessert we split the peanut-butter cheese cake, delicious.  The beverages deserve some mention.  The wine list is this restaurants' only fault, it is tooooo long.  There is a smaller, delicious by-the-glass selection.  The beer selection is well crafted.  I had two of my favorite beers, Dogfishhead Chicory Stout, something I had only had by bottle, wonderful.  I normally don't like high-priced eateries b/c there is often a lack of creativity, Cowboy Ciao doesn't disappoint.  Recommended over any Capital Griller or Flemmingsery for creativity and value for dollar.|1
Tried this place for the first time tonight, and was impressed with absolutely everything. Well-lit building in a decent location in the Arcadia area. I drove here from the Garfield neighborhood and it was well worth it. Juicy chicken and awesome cafeteria throwback crinkle fries, along with one of the best slices of toast I've ever had. All three of these foods were still crispy when I got home, which almost never happens with fast food. I wish I had gotten the girl's name who took care of me. She was cute as a button- very enthusiastic and happy to answer my questions. I'll be back here soon!|1
These guys have the tacos and nachos thing figured out. Great decor and hot, hot waitresses.   We had lunch and it was pretty quiet. Good service. I'm sure things get crazy at night, though!|1
Great gluten free Italian place! Tell all you gluten free friends, they will love you for it!|1
This place is still open, but the name has been changed to Juba, and it is under new ownership. Same spot though, and the food has pretty much stayed the same besides a few changes in the menu.   Anyway, I absolutely love coming here. My friend, Molly, is one of the servers, and I love her for introducing me to Ethiopian cuisine. It's definitely a very interesting blend of flavors, but now I come here about once or twice a week and stuff my face. I recommend trying both the vegan combo and the pita sandwich with chicken or falafel. The coffee drinks are delicious too and since they're made with Ethiopian coffee, the taste is very unique.   If you've been hesitant about trying Ethiopian food, just get over it and go try the food at Juba. You won't be disappointed!|1
Still in love with this place and how much care they really have for all of their clients.   I hit another, I want a piercing moods and swung in on a lunch break last week, determined to get this piercing I thought would be perfect on me.   As usual Jo was absolutely amazing. He brought me back and we discussed what I wanted and when he looked at how my ear was shaped he said that I may want to try something like this (then drawing dots where they would go). He took into consideration my piercing past and said it's subtleness and the petite jewelry would suit me well.  And as always, I came out super impressed and ready to show off my piercings. They still look amazing a week later. I'm still in love, and they are perfectly healthy. Job well done. But I'm not surprised.|1
Great Brisket. There has not been good BBQ in south Scottsdale for a long time. There is now!. The food is wonderful and priced well. Stop in and grab a bite.|1
I absolutely love their personal hotpot room!  I tried it for the first time Sunday...and went back Monday again! Their item portion is big and fresh!  Only downside is that there isn't any sauce that is pre-made... Other than that, this place is AMAZING|1
First time here, new favorite. You can create your own antipasti plate, and the pretzels and fondue are AMAZING. Also the ricotta gnocchi is the best I have ever had. Service was good, Liz was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful. Monkey bread is also stellar. I cannot wait to go back.|1
Still flying solo.  My friends took me for dinner here and it was excellent.  Humus appetizer was great.  For main course did broiled chicken pita wrap and it was perfect.  Recommend!|1
Places like Made make me realize that there is hope for my life in Phoenix.  It is a cute converted house shop that carries a wide array of stuff that you won't find easily elsewhere.    There is lots of cute baby stuff that I would laugh at if I ever saw a baby wearing.  The jewelery is unique and cool- it made me feel like I had etsy right in front of me, live!  They have some good books around and some key David and Goliath pieces.    I heart places like Made, so therefore I heart Made.|1
"I went for brow threading.  Yelena was extremely gentle and took her time making sure they were perfect!  I just found my new ""brow lady"" and she's just across the street from my office! LOVE IT!!!  Give her a try!"|1
Beaver Choice is an excellent place which I have had the chance to visit three or four times.  This is about as home-cooked as you can get in a restaurant.  It's like eating at Mom's house, if Mom happens to be Swedish.  I've had a few of the entrees -- schnitzel cordon bleu, pork medallions, seared gravlax -- and all were delicious.  Especially the gravlax.  The sides are also great, and you usually get three per meal.  The poutine is perhaps not as good as what you'd get in Quebec, but it's easily the best I've had in Arizona.  The fact that they even have poutine wins this place a few points.  I have also had the opportunity to try their dessert specialty, the Beaver Supreme.  This mess of chocolate, meringue, cream, mandarin orange, and possibly a few other things, is the sort of thing which you set out intending to only eat half in the first sitting, but ultimately find your free will diminished, invariably resulting in an empty dish and a fear of the onset of diabetes.  Also, it seems one gentleman gave this place low marks for the long preparation time on a chicken wrap.  I just have to ask, why would anyone go to a Scandinavian restaurant and order a chicken wrap?  Can you imagine what would happen if you wander into a Viking camp and order a chicken wrap?  Your head would be off before you could recite one measly Odinian incantation.|1
Had a great experience. DId not feel gouged or pressured and our dog got the proper treatment for dehydration.  Friendly staff. Prompt service. Special attention from Dr. Heinritz appreciated. Very professional.|1
I've eatin' a lot of pizza and can say without worries that Mama Mia's is the Best I've had -- Consistency, value and great service sets them apart -- They also have the best take out wings in town!!!!|1
If you desire true Chicago deep dish pizza, then Nello's should be at the top of your list! This is a staple pizza location in the Valley- and my family has been going for years. Nello's offers a great menu, drink list, and atmosphere. They offer an excellent Mon-Fri lunch special - a large drink, salad and 2-topping personal pizza for $8.99- what a steal! Don't pass this place up, it's worth it.|1
Yes I do rock the hipster joints.  I dig this place.  A little bit of a scene, but the food is solid and the service is great. Hard not like it.  All in all a great spot.  I tend to switch up my favorites but I typically hit this up for breakfast when in the 602.|1
Since the Gilbert location has closed. The Tempe location has had more things to offer. The staff has really stepped it up on customer service. They do there best on helping you find whatever it is your looking for.|1
"stopped here on our way home on a road trip.  if i had known, i would've stopped on the way out, too.  the bear name drew me in (and the assumption that a diner would have chocolate malts).    the food was fantastic.  boyfriend ordered ""bob's big bear burger"" and it was probably the biggest hamburger i've seen in person.  apparently it was delicious (how he ate the whole thing, i will never know).  i ordered some sort of burger basket combo, featuring a much smaller cheeseburger (which was delicious), hearty portion of fries (which were ok), and the chocolate malt was only $2.99 (instead of $4.50-ish)  with the combo.  And it was one of the best chocolate malts I've ever had.  And the prices were reasonable.  And I actually loved the kitschy bear theme.  Can't wait for another trip that takes me through Phoenix (and I never thought I would say that)."|1
I really enjoy this place. It's beautifully designed. It's hidden in a historic neighborhood, (zoning issues so no patio), and they make they own tonic! ---What else does one need?   But now the food. Rich, full flavored, comfort food. I don't think there is a cuisine style here as far as I could tell, just some of the best food around.   Had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts, awesome. A potato side dish, damn good I tell you. For the main course the skirt steak, which was some of the best red meat I'm had in a very, very long time.   This is my vote for best new restaurant in Phoenix. Seriously.|1
Please give this place a try when you're making your next stop at Pita Jungle. This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked. We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.  An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.  For our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. I've never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly.  For an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.  For dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.  So in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is. The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant, which it definitely is not.|1
"This review corresponds to my first Check-In to Oregano's.   Outside of the wait times, I've not had a bad experience @ Oreganos. The food was good, the people were friendly and I had a good time. This visit was no exception. Even when my wife got meat in her minestrone soup, the situation was handled impressively well. I've known for years that my wife is a VERY picky eater when dining out, she left all smiles and so did I.  It's one of few places I go to with ""stuff"" on the walls that I don't find obnoxious.    Keep up the good work."|1
Being a very experienced pho eater, I must say that the pho at the BlueMoon is excellent!  That, plus the pho is 50% off, so that must have added to my utility.  Veggies were fresh and the service friendly.  Oh, and the appetizer came out only a minute after ordering.  Meal was hot and came out just as we finished the appetizer.  Spent a total of $13.61 (including tax) for (2) large bowls of pho, a Thai ice tea and a order of fresh spring rolls.  Our bellies were stuffed and wallets intact.  Will eat here again!|1
No need for a long review.  Every In-N-Out I have ever been too has been amazing.  Great Food Great Customer Service  Love this place|1
I rented bikes here for the first time today and took them for a ride on the green belt.  It was so fun and the husband and wife working the shop were so friendly and helpful! I will definitely be a returning customer and recommend this to people who are looking for a fun outdoor activity.|1
"AMC Esplanade is by far the most successful navigator of the new ""Dinner and a Movie"" blue ocean the theater industry is starting to penetrate (that's right, I just referenced Blue Ocean Strategy, get over it).  No, it's not an extremely enlightened idea. I've been sneaking Bacardi into theaters since 2003 so it's about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it, but AMC really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from THEM, but also upgraded chairs, and a ton of delicious food (Including the obligatory $4 box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a $9 burger. Like ""Don't mind this $9 full meal over here, we still stand firm that Gummi Bears are worth their weight in gold."")  Yes, it's more expensive than a regular ticket. Almost double for the nice seats. But trust me, YOU WANT THOSE SEATS. You will regret not getting the $15 seats if you don't buy the $15 seats so just pony up the cash and delight in the fact that movie theaters are now almost as comfortable as watching a movie in your own home.   This theater is so nice it even makes bad movies tolerable. I saw The Master here and probably would have stabbed myself in the eye with my embezzled Bacardi flask if I didn't have a comfy recliner and three glasses of wine to get me through it. I seriously won't go to a movie anywhere else and I guarantee you'll say the same once you go. FIVE STARS."|1
"As I passed the velvet rope flanked by shiny, exotic cars I knew I was in for an experience.  Some might call it a fine-dining experience, but clearly this was something more.  A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess, Dominick's is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.  It's glittery, bedazzled, and oozing pretension - and I loved it.  The Service My visit to Dominick's was the night after it's official opening.  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and, while not perfect, the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.  Our server, Drew, let us know that the wait staff only had 2 - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles.  The Food We started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two. And ""Jumbo"" they certainly were, accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.  Ever the daredevil, I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesn't like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner. For the main course we both had the 9-oz filet, lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.  My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center, expertly seared and juicy. Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.  I'm not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasn't particularly excited; I should have been.  The dough was light and fluffy, the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture. After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people.  The tiramisu was spongy and light, with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.  A nice finish to an excellent meal.    Atmosphere We were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.  I bet they didn't make it through the weekend without someone making a splash."|1
I can't believe I haven't wrote a review for Ted's yet! By far, one of my favorite places to go. You can get full off of some tasty food for a great price. I normally get a hot dog with mayo, onion, hot sauce and a pickle. I also like the corn dog and onion rings. I can always get a satisfying and fulfilling meal for $5-7. Love it!  Can get a little crowded on the weekends, but generally all the people are pretty fast and nice.|1
Unfortunately Out of Business.|1
Please excuse this review as I am writing it as I come to from my food coma. We just moved to Phoenix and at the time of dining we were not familiar with the Fox Restaurant Group. We happened upon CD on accident on a Tuesday night. I must say the place was pretty hoppin' for an early week night. We ordered the pretzels with fondue, the fried chicken and the steak. It was so good we didn't even speak to each other through the entire sitting. It was the kind of meal you don't mind having indigestion after because you get the pleasure of re tasting the deliciousness. Gross, I know, but you know what I'm talking about! The server we had was as good as a ghost. We never wanted for anything but he left us alone. I wasn't super crazy about the monkey bread but my honey ate it like we hadn't had a ridiculously large meal 15 minutes before. I'd kinda like to shave off like a 1/4 of a star because the staff was ultra trendy/Indie as were a majority of the patrons. They looked like H&M and Urban Outfitters threw up all over them but if that's the gimmick I'm ok with it since the food was so amazing.|1
I have been here several times now and have never had a bad experience yet.  Good food, good service; no complaints.   Still have never made it here for happy hour, but their specials during that time seem like quite a deal.  The staff are always friendly and seem to remember us from one visit to another.  I've only ever eaten sushi here, but they have a lot of other menu items that I would like to try at some point, but I always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh.  I would recommend trying this restaurant.|1
I love this place!!!!fun poker 3 days a week!!great food!!!great prices!!!even better people!!!!|1
Mail Call is a full service shipping store. The owners are great-they are friendly and accommodating. I purchase shipping supplies from them are their prices are very fair, much less than a larger place up in the airpark. They take care all of my local needs and get the job done. Kudos to Mail Call!|1
Try the Larb, it is on happy hour and it even comes in tofu as a veggie option. This one dish alone ($5) at happy hour would make me love this place but there were many more delights that made my visit so great.  I don't drink with dinner but here it was happy hour all day sat, and they had a unique drink the Curry Gimlet, IT comes in a martini glass has a orange hue, it is fruity but has a curry finish from cardamom I assume, truly unique.  Our dishes of Pad See ewe and Dragon noodles were great, and huge portions.   Rich flavors, well textured tofu and crisp veggies.   When I made my reservation I let them know about the birthday of the person I was with. We were surprised with fried banana and ice cream along with a candle and signing it was great!|1
This is a great MMA gym.  Instructors are profesional, the facility is clean, and they work well with all experience levels.|1
I'm really not the type to want to go out for breakfast, I'd rather save my dining money for lunch or dinner because I figure I can usually make just as good of a breakfast at home.  However, there is no way I could match their french toast, it is just outstanding.  We have been twice and I ordered that both times.  The first time, I told the waitress to put the berry sauce on the side because I usually don't like fruit toppings, they are too sweet and fake tasting.   But this sauce is delicious! It is homemade and very natural tasting, I ate every bit of it.  We also loved the jalepeno bacon.  My kids loved the pigs in a blanket.  We had very nice service both times, we will definitely be back!|1
Ben & Jerry's is still the best chain ice cream shop! The employees are always helpful and polite, and their flavors are just outrageous! The smell of the waffle cones and waffle bowls wafts out the doors as you walk by, and you can't resist. Whether you go for new flavors or classics like Cherry Garcia and Phish Food, you can expect the most flavorful ice cream with the perfect consistency.|1

A heady experience ..this is where lovers go ,a prelude to the interlude of love !|1
Delux is always really good, fresh, and it's a clean place too! I love the beet salad with chicken added. It's delish! My man digs the burgers and we both scarf the sweet potato fries. Love their dipping sauce that comes next to the ketchup, Ah-mazing!|1
Treated some clients to Sweet Pea Bakery items and they loved them!  I got the PB & J cookies , Mojito cookies and Rum macaroons.  Love that they are not the run of the mill flavors.  The shop is adorable, it's actually really big-- surprisingly big!  The employees are really nice and personable and that is always helpful and welcoming, especially when trying something/some place new.   They even gave me a precious thank you card to put with the cookies.     I will definitely be going back for more!|1
When I found out that they do banquets here, I was quick to make a reservation for a wedding rehearsal dinner.  The service was as good as it gets...period.  The food choices my wife and I had to decide on were plentiful, and the result was beyond fantastic!  From the appetizers, to the main courses and finishing with yummy dessert...this place rocks.|1
Visiting a friend who insisted we come to Carolina's on my first morning in town to get a breakfast burrito To Die For.  She was totally spot-on.  These delicious hand-made tortillas are fantastic!  I wish I could take a bunch back to Seattle with me, but since they're freshly-made, I'm guessing the lack of preservatives will make that a better idea than reality.  I enjoyed the chorizo, egg, and potato burrito with plenty of salsa.  I loved the spicy/smooth combo with the sour cream in the burrito.  I hope I get a chance to eat here again before leaving town!|1
"I can always count on Sacks.   It is always fresh and always tasty and the sandwiches are so creative that years later I'm still not sure how they get those fabulous blends and tastes that they do.   I try to hit lunch a little off the lunch hour and then the crowds are not so bad and I can find parking but, its worth it to eat a little latter when I know the meal will be so satisfying I can go back to work and be so productive.   Sacks is my ""go to place"" when I have a guest or friend that I want to be well fed and satisfied too."|1
They really do a great job, and you will really pay for it. I don't have incredibly pricey clothing, so getting my $50 blouses dry cleaned here just doesn't make sense- but I would absolutely trust them with very important articles (nice sport coats, lined trousers, wedding gowns, blood soaked mattresses... haha, kidding).|1
LOVE it and so close to home!  Since Pita Jungle open in Glendale I have been at least once a week (Yes, really!)  The hummus and garlic dip are to die for and on my last trip I tried a Greek Pita-Oh my!  The fruit on the Caribbean salad and the fruit and cheese plate are amazing and the chicken combo plate is so large it's two meals!  The ambiance is slightly different than the other locations but I think that is mostly due to the fact that two sides of the restaurant are glass.  Pita Jungle Glendale still features a revolving collection of art work and you can see the funky style of the other locations in the hand painted chairs and the cool artwork painted in the bathrooms.  The staff is also  extremely friendly.|1
"As a bonafide recovering Art Bitch, I give this university gallery the blue ribbon award for kickassery!  Truly a ""hidden gem"" (i hate that phrase) in Tucson, the collection and the revolving pieces never cease to impress me. I have brought almost every single tourist from the east coast to this gallery, including some photography professors, and they leave with snoooty mouths agape that in this pleasant little desert town resides a high-caliber, well manicured collection of the arts.   I am always upset when I visit and I can't stop by this gallery-and don't miss out out on their catalogs, magazines, books, postcards and prints they have in the atrium as unique gifts/decoration.  Splleeeendid."|1
Woo Hoo!  Little Caesars opens in Fountain Hills!  Yummy pizza.|1
My boyfriends company has been doing business with this PostNet store for the last 4 years. Service is friendly, prompt and helpful.  I highly recommend it.|1
My absolute favorite coffee shop - I'm a regular! Friendly atmosphere & staff, buttery fluffy muffins, ooey gooey danishes, tasty coffee, and support for local businesses and entrepreneurs.  The only negative for me is the mysterious disappearance of the corn tortilla bagel (much yummier than it sounds)!|1
Yes, it is small, yes, it takes time to get your order, but the quality of the food serve is excelent !!! Celina is the name of the owner (not Selena) of this fabulus resturant.  She takes your order, runs to the kitchen and then she serves your order too. I wouldn't say that this is a one person resturant, because she has help in the kitchen.   Very few Mexican resturants in Phoenix serve food as good as this one. The Menu is limited but whatever you order you will not be disappointed.|1
What can I say...Maharaja Palace was my midday getaway while living out in Phoenix, and I miss it dearly.  I visit as often as I can (up to three times a year, traveling from Hawaii) and when I do, I am always astounded by the flavors and array of choices this buffet provides.  The tiki marsala happens to be my favorite dish and I find the staff to be accomodating and attentive, especially when ensuring I've got enough na'an to sop up my plate's delightful curries.  I can't wait to return.  This is THE SPOT for Indian Food in the PHX Metro Area, hands down!|1
Did you know that Malee's on Main offers cooking classes!?  They offer them twice a month during tourist season and once per month during the rest of the year.  I attended two weeks ago, and it was OUTSTANDING!  Not only did we learn to cook Thai (which, incidentally, it was significant to learn that Thai gets its flavor by layering is sauces), but we were given the recipes for some of the signature dishes, served tastings, a meal, and wine pairings, and we were even given goody bags.  It was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with another foodie!|1
"Okay ya wanna know a little secret? I LONG for Green. Ever since moving back to New Orleans I'm surrounded by an embarrassment of culinary riches but our one vegetarian restaurant can never hold its own against Green. I passed through Scottsdale a few weeks ago to visit the Grand Canyon and the second I stepped off the plane at the Phoenix airport and secured the rental car we drove straight to the restaurant. Everything was just like I remembered it and slightly better. The staff was warmer and the food just as good. I'm still thinking about the ""crab"" puffs and the eggless rolls."|1
"We have been meaning to try The Mission for awhile, and we were extremely impressed. We are self-professed foodies, good cooks, etc. Let's start with the fact that they seated us promptly at our reservation time, and that reservation had only been made that day.....surprising, because the place was packed!! Alfonso was our waiter, and he was awesome and didn't hesitate to make suggestions that we were happy to add to our dinner. First, the margaritas. ....this place knows how to pour, and they are fresh  - the only way we will drink them. Next - there are only 3 places in Phoenix that can make good table-side guacamole, and this is the best of them. Alfonso suggested a fried pork belly/cola reduction appetizer that I had to be talked into. OMG....heaven, and such a complex blend of flavors that the sweet, crunchiness of the pork belly can only be described as ""worth it"" if you are balking at the issue of pork belly. Entree: we chose the Chorizo Porchetta and the Scallops. Both were excellent and may I say that the timing of each course was unbelievably prompt. We never waited and yet didn't feel rushed. Dessert: I confess that I read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions, and while other reviews loved the selections ...I wasn't blown away. The churros were small and dough-y, and the milkshake was just to heavy/sweet after a meal.....better to fill the churros with a cheese and serve them warm on dulce de leche ice cream. Fried bananas didn't excite me either. Bananas are bananas..... The pumpkin bread pudding seemed heavy and Autumn-like for a 110 degree day in Arizona and did not compliment the Latin flavors of the dinner. I feel their dessert menu needs to be expanded in a way that compliments their cuisine....some citrus sorbet, chocolate-with-red-chile cake, lime cheesecake. At any rate, I still give them the full Monty on stars!!!"|1
I love this place. They are so accommodating and the food is delicious. They made a special meal for my daughter and were happy to do it. Our server was helpful and friendly.  I had the roasted beet salad and the ingredients were very fresh and tasty. I can't wait to go back.|1
So happy to have another option in our great restaurant rich neighborhood. The space is much larger than it appears from the street, and is broken up really well into comfortable areas. The open kitchen really does have an Italian country feel, and the lighting gives the very large open room a warm feel. Nice large bar as well. Best of all is the number of walls that open up to the outside-perfect for this time of year. Our server had the perfect combination of personality and humor-not too much, just right. The menu has a great selection, no matter your appetite. The Burratta was nice and creamy, with a nice compliment of apple slices and Rocket. The potatoes with parmesan, rosemary and perfect lemony aioli were off the chain. I wanted an order to take home! Pizza crust is very tasty and perfect texture. Hanger steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The brunch menu looks super yummy-we definitely have a new hangout on the hood. Great job, Sam Fox!|1
I love this place they do the best job, I even drive 45 min because I moved and they are worth it! I'm always happy with the results. My nails don't lift or chip. I have also had a facial their and it was amazing. It was my first facial however I was happy and it wasn't expensive. I would recommend this place to anyone. Just bring cash for your tip, they do take cards but not for tips.|1
The Great Indoors is a phenomenal place to get lost and dream about what you would like to have your home look like.  WARNING!!!  You will want to spend money!  On average their prices are pretty run of the mill dept. store style, it is their selection that is amazing.  They have far more selection than any other store I have ever been to.  The store is also well organized and laid out and everything is easy to find.  One final note, while not a place for extreme bargain hunters if you play your cards right you can get some great deals.  I just purchased all of our appliances for our home at a 20% discount.  Again, not the best discount I have seen but getting them all at once, not having to look around, and still getting $2 back for every $10 I spend is pretty darn nice!  Oh and if you need appliances, ask for Andy/Andrew... He is a great help and honest as can be!|1
"My meal at FnB last weekend was one of the best I've had in Arizona. I love everything about this place, the food, the cocktails, the staff, the atmosphere.  It was a rainy Sunday. I knew the restaurant was right next to Cowboy Ciao, but managed to walk right by it (my friends noticed me go by). I turned back, and Pavle was nice enough to wait at the door, and said ""Ben?"" as I was about to pass by again. I agree with what everyone else said here, Pavle really makes you feel at home.  I started with the slivered fennel salad and a ginhound. I split the order with a friend, and they were more than happy to bring the salad split  onto two plates for us. I love citrus, and these were a very refreshing start to my meal.   Next up was the trout. It was presented stacked on top of the sunchokes and caramelized onions, with some wonderful broth on the plate. The combination of flavors was rich, and amazing, and the presentation ensured that every bite was as good as the last. I could eat this every visit, but I sampled the chicken and lamb, and was just as blown away. For desert I had lemon cake with ice cream and strawberry compote.   FnB has been receiving a lot of positive buzz lately. It's well deserved. If you haven't visited yet, you're missing out."|1
This place is super cute lunch joint.  I had the sloppy joe special and it reminded me of a home cooked meal back in the day.  I ended my meal with a classic vanilla milkshake which was superb.  Oh yeah!  if you're in a hurry for a quick good sit down lunch, this place is it.  our food came out SO fast.  I will be returning shortly.  You also MUST check out the vintage clothing/ furniture in the room next door before you leave !|1
"I've never been to this location before. My husband had taken his car here previously, and asked me to take it in today (there was a nail a front tire). The second I stepped through the doorway I was greeted, even though all agents were busy helping other customers -- excellent customer service to acknowledge I'm there!   Less than a minute later I had a gentleman walk me out to the car and look at it. He tested to see how far in the nail was, and realized it didn't puncture, so he took it out and said the tire was fine.   I went there knowing my husband is WAY overdue for new tires, so asked for a quote. He gave me a few options, and told me what driving habits they'd be best for. He also gave me the warranty information without me asking for it, and included it in the price instead of ""shockingly"" adding it in when I would pay like most places would. I never thought for a second that I was being oversold. It was amazing because I despise going anywhere having to do with fixing my car.   Quick. Clean. Friendly. Intelligent. Honest. That about sums up this place. I'd recommend it to ANYONE and tell you to go out of your way to visit this location."|1
Impossibly good Italian deli in the middle of the desert. Huge sandwiches on the most incredible bread you've ever had outside of NY. As someone who ate here 3 times in a 24 hr period, I feel especially compelled to tell you about their cheesesteak. HO-LY-SHIT. Easily the most decadent, flavorful cheesesteak I've had in a VERY long time - and I live 15 minutes outside of Philly. Im still in disbelief that they could pull something like that off. Ask for yours on the soft roll.  I should also mention the sausage,  peppers & onion sandwich, which was really good. I suspect they make their own sausage, which elevates them to superstar status in my book. The chicken parm sandwich and dinner are both equally good, and the meatball sandwich deserves honorable mention as well.  I dont do cold subs, but the ones I saw coming out of the kitchen looked huge and tasty. Perhaps I will try their pizza next time I'm in town.|1
Awesome awesome awesome!!! Our table all ordered a 5 course tasting  and it was amazing!! The flavors pop in your mouth!! Very creative chef. I don't think there was one course we were disappointed in. By the end of the 3 hour dinner we had a total of 21 courses. Each one full of flavor making you want more. The staff was excellent, always there when you need them but not hovering. I would definitely go again. Pricey but so worth it!!|1
I hate ordering flowers sight unseen, but needed a local florist for a sympathy arrangement. Rachel immediately alleviated any concern when we discussed what I wanted in detail, and she even emailed me a photo of the final arrangement.  Gorgeous flowers, same day delivery and reasonable pricing - can't beat that.|1
Move over Maizie's you've been replaced...for brunch that is. I have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to Maizie's for their brunch and getting smashed. Oh, and we eat a little too.  Everything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut. The food was so ridiculous good, that we actually forgot to drink. Did you hear me?? FORGOT TO DRINK!!  Since it was our first time there, we ordered a variety of options. I had the Country Toast, which was toasted MJ Bread, topped with Italian Ham, Gruyere Cheese, and a sunny-side up egg. Ho-ly shit. Each bite became increasingly better than the last. It was the perfect bite over and over and over again. The ham had a nice little spice to it, the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it, the egg was, well, an egg, and the toast really brought it all together incredibly. And it was huge. I barely got through half if it before I had to give up.  My brunch date got Postino's take on French Toast. To be honest, I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning, however I would have bathed in this french toast. It was creamy, not overly sweet, and literally melted in my mouth.  I ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute, I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal. Me. Ignoring anything in a champagne flute. I know.  I feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy, but I'm sorry Maizie's, consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out!|1
Perfect burritos, polite staff with a couple cuties working here.  I love Chipotle!|1
This place is an experience.  I can't stop thinking about it!!!  I love the weird odd flavors (Basil Lime?)  and everything tastes so fresh and organic.  It's nice to have something like this close by our house!  A true guilty pleasure.|1
The restaurant itself is not fancy and does not have an amazing atmosphere, but I really love the food here. I've eaten in the restaurant a few times and frequently get takeout. I love the Gobi Manchurian, Vegetable Vindaloo, and Special Vegetable Curry. I also like the weekend buffet - it's a great way to try several different things. Delicious!|1
I had lunch today at CASK 63 with a banker to discuss our collective power to create business in the Phoenix Market. I HAD THE ABSOLUTE BEST CRAB SALAD, I've had since leaving the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Red Crab Salad....fresh, clean, sweet, crisp..light...in a very well appointed setting. Very  good iced teas as well....hard to find in Phoenix.....Go there...Eat there...you will like it..and we might see one another...who knows...be like nike..just do it...:)|1
Had the pastrami sandwich. It brought me back memories of living in NYC and eating that first pastrami. It was good.  Good food hAs the power of time travel.   This is a great place. Plus the coke is primo. Good mixture. The ice makes it over the top.|1
I have been visiting Mrs. White's going on 30 years, but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken, my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation - I almost got cold feet.  Good thing I didn't. The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.  When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes.   I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day.   To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.  I love this place and hope I always will.|1
"Great selection of vitamins and supplements, good prices and I can get the special treats our cat likes while I'm picking up the goods for myself. Plus their rewards program is pretty straightforward.  I also like that they are not ""all over you"" like the other local chain is when you walk in the door.   I highly recommend the Vitamin Shoppe on Camelback!"|1
Been here a few times, and each time it it's the best Thai food I have had in Az. Service has been consistently great. Has a full bar with some good specialty drinks that sometimes take some time to make but are worth the wait. Lots of mid day food and drink specials. I've tried six dishes here every one has been excellent. Portion sizes are about on par with the average of the many Thai restaurants I've tried in the east valley, while menu prices are below the average. I think Thai Spices offers a good value for some great food and drink and I can't wait to come back.|1
Once again Wildflower proves why it's my favorite breakfast hangout! Jeff the Manager on staff today rocks!   Some of us hangout at a restaurant to make it a working meal...and sometimes, during that time Nature calls...so I asked the busboy to not clear my table as I needed to step away for a moment and he cheerfully agreed. I came back to find my table cleared by new patrons who had taken it upon themselves to steal my table (I guess the fact that the food was only half eaten, and the water and coffee were still half filled were no clue). The busboy was upset that he'd turned his back for just a moment and Jeff came to the rescue...after apologizing to me and finding the perfect way to make it right, he vowed to let the new people know that they were rather um 'overly proactive' in clearing the table themselves and that he had some people who regularly relaxed and worked in the restaurant and do step away.  He handled the situation with me just right and I am sure that those people that took my table were made to gently understand that they need to ask before taking an uncleared table.  Kudos to Jeff and the staff for making me so happy I had to tell everyone here...and to the couple who took my table, if you are reading this...did you REALLY need that booth? I mean, when I came out of the can there were like, I dunno, 5 empty tables...seriously? Like, did you propose there or something????|1
These are absolutely my favorite donuts in the whole wide world!!! No offense to those Krispy Kreme lovers out there but I think Lamar's has them beat!   Their donuts are always so fresh and delicious! My absolute favorite is the chocolate iced cake donut with m&m's. Just thinking about them is making me salivate! ;-)!!   I suggest getting there earlier rather than later because sometimes they sell out of certain varieties.|1
How can you go wrong with tortillas and pastries in one location?  I honestly don't understand how this little Mexican bakery stays in business  given everything is practically free. My hubby and I bought two empanadas for me (like a little pie or turnover), flan for him, a dozen tortillas, and 2 red burritos.  I guess you need to get there early because they were out of red tamales at 2 pm on a Friday.    The empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it.  I had lemon and cherry, but I wanted to try one of everything.  The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful.  Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldn't wait to get home to devour mine.  They could double their prices and I would still come back!  I forgot to mention the bakery is spotless, so clean I would eat off the floor if I had to.|1
LOVE THIS PLACE!  We eat here every Saturday as long as we are in town.  My husband eats here during the week too!  Weekday lunches are a great deal and quick!  The veggie soup is delicious.  The golden wings - Delicious... chicken satay is good too.  For an entree... we always get Pad Prik King chicken or sometimes shrimp but its always always delicious!  Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home (east valley) but haven't found one yet!  Service is terrific!  FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai... it is very sweet here so if you don't like it sweet... order something else.  Other things we've tried that were good... pepper steak - very good - just dont eat a lot of red meat, massamum curry with chicken good... also we order everything medium to thai hot... like very spicy!|1
One of my most favorite coffee shops! Location for sure. Soooo cute here. Inside and out. The patio is beautiful and you feel like you're in a diff city for a moment. Coffee is pretty darn good. Not the best, but good. And the menu is great. I am a vegetarian and they have many options for us. The treats are amazing. The staff is amazing. And they always seem to play great music too. Love this place. Wish it were not so far away in Mesa...|1
Here's how to do Pizzeria Bianco the right way:  1. Show up at 3:30 or earlier to get a good place in line. Make sure you bring some friends to enjoy the time together and the great food. 2. At 4:00, the bar opens. Get yourself a bottle of wine and make the best of the 90 minutes you'll spend just waiting to get on the seating list. 3. Order a few appetizers from the bar; they're light and fresh and yummy. 4. When you finally get seated for dinner, don't hold back. Order salads, share different pizzas, and have a coffee after.  The quality of the food is ABSOLUTELY worth the wait. We tried eating here a few times over the past couple of years, but realized it takes commitment and two bottles of wine to make it through the line. Best pizza I've had since Italy. Bravo Bianco!|1
I love Scottsdale Child Care & Learning Centers. My daughter started going there when she was 10 months old. The teachers are wonderful. Not only are they nurturing and kind they are also very interested in each child.   My Daughter  has been attending for 6 months now and has graduated to room 2 for toddlers. She knows over 30 words and I attribute much of that to Scottsdale Child Care. She has loved all her teachers and welcomes with open arms each morning when I drop her off.  I would recommend this center to any parent, especially if you are nervous about leaving your loved one for the first time.|1
Love massages and facials!  I would highly recommend Enrique for a massage.  Great technique.  Great membership prices and great walk-in schedule for those last minute needs.|1
"This is not an Asian Topless Bar. It is an Asian ""Tapas"" bar. The guys I was traveling with spent the first ten minutes waiting for the show to start and were disappointed when I smacked them all for actually thinking I would take my coworkers to a topless bar.   ""Tapas"" are little appetizer plates, and Sens is all about getting a little taste of everything. The atmosphere is fantastic - eclectic, moody and very, very cozy (so I recommend reservations).   The little dishes are about four single servings, so you'll want to order several plates! Highly recommend the volcano flamed beef and the sugar cane pork. The food is very flavorful -- but everything is a bit spicy (garlicky-spicy), even the dishes they call ""mild.""   Plates run about $6-$9 each, and each person in our party ordered 3 or 4 plates...we were all full by the time we left! Definitely get a cocktail, their mixed drink menu is fab (White Sin is absolutely sinful...and absolutely worth the indulgence)."|1
I attended one of her classes for pressure cookers, and had to leave with one. Luckily, she offers great discounts after her classes!  Since then I have also gotten a bosch mixer (don't know how I lived without one all these years!) and also a wheat grinder. Everytime I go in here I find something I can't live without!  Shar has great classes, and tips on how to utilize all her products. Well worth it to attend a class. I just wish the store was closer to Glendale!  So glad I found shar's, now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too!|1
My son comes here for the tacos but I am all about the chile relleno.  I never had one with potatoes inside, but oh my, this was the best!  My only recommendation would be to order it dry, with the sauce on the side.  I am counting the days until I get back to AZ.  The new location is so much closer to us, I plan on trying all of their menu, but....but... that chile relleno is ....calling....me.......! The tacos were very very good though.|1
Hands down the best cupcakes in the Phoenix market. Tammie Coe comes in second with the coconut but sometimes it's not as fresh as it could be at LGO. Milk chocolate is great, taste a sprinkle - it's really chocolate not wax. I had salted caramel it was wonderful. Dark chocolate is decadent. I did try the red velvet and it was good but I'm done trying to understand red velvet. I just don't get it.|1
Yes, before you ask, I still love Desert Stages Theatre, perhaps more than ever.  This is Andrew's fifth play there and this time he plays the Knave in Alice in Wonderland. Normally, we don't ask for a specific role but the director of Annie Jr. thought he would be cute as the Dormouse as he popped up from the table so that's what we asked for this time during audition. And we anxiously waited for the casting to be posted.  When the casting was posted, he did not get the requested part and as a mom and a parent, I was glad. Why you may ask?  Because to me as a mom and a parent, it's very important to teach my son the importance of handling success with graciousness and moving through disappointments with a positive attitude.  When he asked why he didn't get the part, I told him in simple words that the director had a vision of what the whole play should be like and she saw Andrew in the role of Knave and that was his special role.  I also told him that it doesn't matter what role you get, if you play it with all you got and go out there and perform with your heart as there are no small parts, you will capture the audience's attention and that will be your moment. He listened with a typical 5 year old attitude and became very excited about being the Knave.  And I was also excited for him because this time around, he had 2 long lines to memorize and speak! With each review, I've written about how Andrew has grown through DST and here I've included a video where you can see him growing aware of theatre and performance:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsG07sMlZ5s&feature=related.  This time around, he started asking me if he was a main character, starting to understand the structure of a performance.  It was great to see his awareness growing.  I highly recommend bringing your own child to audition for a play here.   It will be an amazing experience!! Really, DST is about the kids.  Trusting the kids to do their part and giving them responsibilities.  Once the curtain lifts, the kids are responsible for THEIR performance and for each other.  It's fantastic to see the kids have their moments on stage, being responsible for moving and arranging the set, take care of the tech, go from loose energy backstage to fanstatic actors on stage.  It's all fabulous. If you have doubts of what kids can do, go to a show at Desert Stages Theatre and be amazed.  Truly, if you believe in your kids, as DST shows again and again, your kids will shine and raise above your expectations!|1
Cute busy place in Central Phoenix. Not hiding behind gimmicks to make themselves authentic. Simple and sweet. Staff is well versed in Japanese food, if you haven't had it in years ask. Great staff, great food, great times.|1
Recently was invited to this restaurant & found out that they have children's plates for adults or any age.  It was SUPER CHEAP & it included a drink with refills like tea or soda etc.  What a deal!  Under 5. bucks including the drink.  I will definitely  be going back  to any Cracker Barrel who has this deal because it is cheaper than fast food etc. or just about anywhere.|1
I have been going to Cartel for a while, and their coffee has absolutely spoiled me. I can hardly drink coffee or esspresso from anywhere else, I even buy their beans and brew it at home. Most of the bartista's are stellar, but expect to wait for your specialty drinks, not only because they are almost always busy, but also because making kick ass coffee drinks takes time. I suggest either the Honduras with cream, an iced agave latter, or a cappuccino (which you have to drink there).|1
"Those of us ""foodies"" know that if the company is not good, the food is not good...regardless...which is why I am happy to give Bar North such a great review.  I was there with a terrific group of people [STAR 1].  We were able to relax on the patio (with clean furniture, I might add) overlooking the fountains, in an intimate setting where we could hear one another [STAR 2].  The wine list was good, at a fair (i.e., expected) price [STAR 3].  The appetizers and salads were awesome [STAR 4].  And the waitstaff (Damn, I wish I could remember her name!) was incredible [STAR 5].  'nough said."|1
This is the best Cajun place in Arizona. The portions are great and the people behind the counter are really nice. I love gumbo and I have tried several kinds here and all of them were excellent. Yes the decor isn't 5 stars but seriously if you're more worried about mood lighting and soft cushions you can go to Pappadeaux's and get charged an arm and a leg for lower quality food. the drive and the price are definitely worth it for this place.|1
We recently took a weekend getaway to Phoenix and stayed here. The Hotel is beautiful and our rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The staff here are topnotch. I love the lobby wine & hot apple cider hour in the afternoons, and the lobby coffee & hot chocolate bars in the mornings. We had access to the Golds Gym across from the hotel and were able to get a good workout in their cardio theatre. There is an outdoor skating rink right outside and a small shopping/dining area. It is located right across from the stadium and could walk to our event. I would definitely recommend staying here, especially if you are attending an event at the arena.|1
If I could give it more than 5, I would.  Sweet Pea and I live down the street, literally DOWN THE STREET, from this bar.  We waited for it to open for what seemed like decades, praying that this was going to be the type of place that could become our local.  It has exceeded our expectations.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The drinks are amazing- every last one of them- but the margaritas are the best I've ever had.  They tasted like a fresh squeeze of sunshine that makes me happy inside.  Margarita Mondays- $4 margs AND free food?  Happy hours are amazing.  New Year's Eve last year was amazing.  The 1 year anniversary party was amazing.  But most of all, the owner and staff are some of the coolest peeps that you'll ever meet.  Go here.  You will love it.|1
This place is absolute perfection.  From the setting to the service to the food, I loved every moment of it.  The only way I found out about this place was through Yelp.  You seriously are my trusty sidekick.  From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed, but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries. Walking in the restaurant, it is quite small, but just absolutely adorable.  It really does feel like an upscale country home.  Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table.  Even the touches of place setting are just perfect. Our server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart.  We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper.  Both were absolutely delightful!  Then we moved on to appetizers, because while getting drunk is fun, I was really excited for the food.  We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce.  I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.  Put fried egg on top of anything and I'm sold.  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and I'm in love!  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!  The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!  Well that, along with the bread and butter.  But that still wasn't enough for me!  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness! After Gina cleared that out of our way, she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend.  I hate when I don't have a drink in front of me, and she made sure that never happened.  Then the entrees came.  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.  Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.  I'm getting hungry again just writing about it.  My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.  Could life get any better? Well apparently it could!  After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.  And the berries with the creme fraiche.  Heaven in my mouth!  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini. This review cannot do this place justice.  This is truly a unique experience that is far above any of the restaurants in Scottsdale.  Please go in and experience this for yourself, you will not be disappointed!|1
"Navajo Food at it's best !!!!!! I loved everything there ! I guess I love ""BLAND"" food . :-) everything was terrific ...   I ordered the bowl (12 oz) of Mutton Hominy Stew I got it with the Tortilla bread which was AMAZING ! I also ordered a side of Blue Corn Mush to dip into my stew ( which is an awesome combination) ... And I also ordered a Grape Shasta Soda :-D ... My Husband ordered the Vegetable Mutton Stew with fry bread and ordered Strawberry Shasta Soda. He loved everything !  Everything was well worth the wait and the food was extra hot and tasted very FRESH !!! I LOVED IT !"|1
Lives up to the local fuss. Quick, cheap, tasty and one of the few fast Mexican food restaurants that utilize yellow cheese, which is my cardinal rule of good Mexican food.|1
there is none better.  This taco shop is off the beaten path hidden and mixed in next to a smoke shop and behind a circle k.  Parking can be at a premium but the payoff is the food.  great friendly service, low key on the inside and flavors and textures that rock your socks off!!  I mean really.  My favorite taco shop in the valley, or more to the point prob. one of the best in the west!  the burros are as think as a mans arm, the tacos are soooo good. i especially like the chorizo, the lingua is good, the carne is excellent.  have a cane sugar coke in a bottle and find a seat, inside or out you will savor the flavors and be sure to use the sides of grilled peppers and onions, they make the meal for me.  now where to go for lunch ?|1
I love this place.  Great food, great service from some of the nicest staff, and just a fun place to go.  It is also a place I like to meet people for happy hour.  They have a wonderful selection of beers, fantastic wines, and I have never once had anything but great food while eating there.|1
Best muffler shop in town. There are VERY few shops that I trust, and Mighty Muffler is one of them.  Greg has worked on multiple cars and has always done a great job.  If there is ever any issues he takes care of the problem, no questions asked.|1
YUMMMMMM!!!! I was brought to this place by a friend and was so glad to find it! Very clean and unique casual setting. Staff were very friendly, food was hot, fresh and amazingly gooy...definately a 4+ napkin kind of meal. So happy to see they serve Chicken philly -steak as well as the usual philly cheese steak and sweet potatoe fries! Find out where this place is because it could be easily over looked and you would be missing out on some deeee-licous food. This place is a must try!|1
This place is as good as I'd heard.  We came here for a day-late birthday dinner for my middle daughter/Father's Day dinner for her husband.  She and his six-year old daughter ordered a Hawaiian style with pineapple and ham, he and I  got the Margherita Pizza with garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, fresh basil, mozzarella, and romano cheese.  Both were so delicious!  He also got some chicken wings which were tender and juicy and not spicy at all, dipped in either of two great sauces, ranch or marinara.  The pizza's were about $13 each for the larges.  I usually have no problem quitting after two slices but the  flavor squishing around in my mouth was so good I couldn't resist taking a third piece at this place.   The decor was pretty and the service was great--the server checked back several times to see if we were doing okay or needed anything.   I would definitely be a regular if I lived near here.     On a side note, next door is the Aloha Kitchen which we had eaten at about a week ago and was also very good!  62010|1
FANTASTIC little lunch/brunch spot! Went here with the family while visiting Scottsdale and really enjoyed it!   We had the Tuna Melt, which was delicious with their spiked cottage cheese!  The cranberry chicken salad made into a sandwich was DELICIOUS!   The omelets and scrambles looks great - I didn't taste, but then again, there was nothing left on the plate! LOL   Smaller place so could be busy during peak hours, may call or try and hit an off time. Service was ok, wasn't anything special but the food was really cute and made for a really cute little lunch spot!|1
I love that this Safeway is right across the street from my work. I like to walk here for a bit of exercise to get lunch. The deli is awesome. They have a sandwich bar that has these really great gourmet ingredients they will make a sandwich for you. For 5.49 it's not too bad and if you use your Safeway card you buy 7 get the 8th sandwich free. They also have premade salads and a hot bar as well. Very friendly, Alan who has made my sandwiches the last couple weeks is very friendly and does a good job. Bonus points the Starbucks is right next to it!|1
Hands down, best slices in Scottsdale....|1
I really enjoyed my mani/pedi with Trisha!  She took her time and taught me about manicuring my nails from home which I loved.  I went in for the Groupon basic mani/pedi deal and left feeling like I got a lot more! It was the most pleasant experience I've had at a nail salon. The conversation was easy and Trish is a great person. I will be coming back to Trish for nails again!   The entire staff was friendly and professional. Great Salon!!|1
"Whitney walked into Renegade Canteen and never had a chance. Nor did any of her previous favorite Scottsdale spots.   The green chile pork stew is enough to make a good date great or a bad date totally tolerable. Tender, juicy, sent from above...having this dish once is not enough. You won't have the heart to inform your mother that after tasting McGrath's bowl of deliciousness, any pork dish she's ever prepared seems dry and flavorless.   We can only hope that the clouds in heaven are made of the mashed potatoes. I get them every time. The filet was the best steak I've ever had (I've thought about it, trust me) and the Dr. Pepper braised short rib will give you something else to think about the next time the Kiss ""Dr. Love"" commercial comes on.   yummmmmmers."|1
Simply the best automotive repair place I've yet found in Phoenix. Honest, fair, and competent. I've taken three vehicles there for service over several years now and never been dissatisfied.|1
If you are looking for only raw vegan food, this is your place.  Nothing is cooked, everyhthing is 100% raw.  They offer a variety of creative options from appetizers, wraps, soups, pizza and pasta.  They have freshly squeezed juices, smoothies and a variety of different health shots.  The dessert is yummy as well.  This is a must try!|1
Wow!  This place is amazing.  So amazing I went there twice in a week.  I will start with my dinner.  The ambiance was great.  The place has a nice warm feeling to it and since it was cold outside it was really nice.  They had a large fireplace inside and after dinner we stayed for the great crowd that showed up and went outside.  It was pretty chilly but I didn't even notice as the fire pit was big enough to warm everyone around it.  They also had ample heat lamps.    The food was fantastic.  I had the tomato soup with the grilled cheese crouton in it and it warmed me up and prepped me for my main meal.  I had the burger and tender belly bacon.  This was an amazing treat for my taste buds.  The bacon was not like any bacon I have had on a burger.  It was a perfect complement for each other.  I wanted another one when I was done but couldn't possibly eat anymore.   The drinks were great.  They have an amazing wine selection.  The wines we were drinking were affordable and it looks like they really spent some time picking the right wines to carry.  They have some really nice wines that rival the selection of some of the really nice wine bars in Scottsdale as well.  My friends said that the mixed drinks were really well made and they were very happy with how they turned out.  They have just about everything you could want for mixed drinks.  Service was amazing as well.  They were really attentive and the owner stopped by to talk to our table.    Lunch  The lunch was just as good as the dinner.  I had a shrimp BLT that rivals anything in AZ.  I was glad to see that had a variety of Dr. Pepper/Mr. Pibb on tap.  It was really relaxing to sit there at lunch and enjoy the crowd.  The service was excellent.  Overall I highly recommend Vintage 95 for lunch or dinner.  It is a great place for a date at night and you can enjoy the great crowd afterwards with great conversation and ambiance to fit.|1
Culver's is a must if you have not had the chance to try them out. I believe they have several stores now here in the valley. The Root Beer is a must as well as the Butter Burgers, Cheese curds, Frys, Frozen custurd....lol ...the list goes on... I have not found anything as of yet that I did not enjoy.|1
First off, I am not a Cubs fan.  But I came here to watch them play the A's during spring training and thought this park rocked.  Its cozy enough get within heckling distance of the players, but it has a lot of the amenities of Wrigley Field...including Old Style beer and florescent green hot dog relish.  All this and sunshine too!  What's not to like?|1
My family and I ate here Saturday night.....based on the reviews of Yelp. We were not disappointed, as a matter of fact, we were pleasantly surprised with every aspect of our evening.  When you arrive at Bobby Q's, the outside makes it feel as if you are about to walk into a dive.  However when you turn the corner and walk in the door, that is not the case.  Very nice ambiance throughout the entire restaurant. They had wonderful mood lighting! I love low mood lighting!  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  Our meals were excellent.  My husband got the Chicken Fried Chicken and I got the Top Sirloin.  We started with the corn bread, which was delicious!  I don't care if it feel apart at least it wasn't dry!  My top sirloin was cooked a perfect Medium and seasoned exceptionally well.  I really loved it and I love steak.  Surprisingly the roasted corn was one of my favorites of the night, I don't usually gobble up corn when I get it with dinner, but man, this was some heavenly corn!  My husbands chicken fried chicken was perfect.  Pounded thin, with a light crispy batter, I hate to say it, but it might have been better than Texaz Grill's chicken!  It was tasty.  My son got the oven cooked pepperoni pizza and it was a large portion for the $4.00 price tag, he even took some home.  Our food was excellent, there wasn't one thing we didn't like, the food was hot, the service was great, the atmosphere was great, we will return!|1
I grew up at this library.  And now I am old and married and hope to someday take my very own kids to this library.  They have a great selection of audio books.  I am a major audio book fan and this is the place to be!   Clean, safe, you are not bothered by stranger dangers.  I dig this library.|1
Dr. Jones was very friendly and understanding!|1
This place has it all. Fresh food. Vintage decor. Outdoor misting system for those uncomfortabley-sweaty summer days. Plenty of scooter parking. Beautiful shade trees (watch out for scorpions!). Oh and did I mention the food?  My favorite item by far has to be the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Tender grilled chicken breast smothered in tangy wing sauce nestled between a toasty bun that has been smeared with blue cheese and crunchy celery. It's heaven in a bite.  Coupled with a serving of Sweet Potato Fries, this is a party in your mouth and every taste bud is invited. (Even that anti-social one on the back of your tongue that doesn't know how to dance.)|1
I love the owners.  Very friendly and accomodating.  One night we had called after they had closed, and were pleasantly surprised when someone answered.  Turns out they were hosting a private party.  They agreed to take our order, which made us pretty happy.  I adore their Greek fries.  Olive oil, lemon, and the perfect amount of fetta.  Been here several times for lunch, and always leave happy.  Looking forward to meeting friends here for happy hour.|1
He's been the top vote-getting General Dentist in Phoenix Magazine for three years in a row for a REASON, folks. He has an office in Chandler and in Mesa but even if you live in Minnesota, he's worth the drive.|1
LOVE this place. Great food, high quality ingredients (which is why i was told the prices are a bit more than your typical pizza hut), and fun service.  I love this place, and always leave happy and full. Authentic italian food is my weak spot! :)|1
Super friendly. Joe was there greeting everyone, refilling coffee, and sharing how we uses local Arizona suppliers. Great diner food and decor. Loved the biscuits and chorizo gravy.  Will definitely be back.|1
Great service|1
Fried Squash blossoms!  How do they come up with this stuff?  FnB gets 5 stars for creativity and service... oh, and the food is pretty amazing too!   The menu changes with the season, so I apologize in advance for making your mouth water by mentioning  food you'll probably never taste.   We started off with the appetizer special, Fried Squash blossoms stuffed with burrata served with fresh tomato sauce, and an order of naan with eggplant puree.  The Naan plate was nothing special, but the blossoms were fantastic.  For dinner Hottie had the lab chops with couscous and I had the pasta with butternut squash and pesto.   The pasta was amazing, I watched the chef make my pesto to order... mmmm basil!  Hottie devoured every bite, so I would say he enjoyed his chops too.  For desert we shared the panna cotta with cherries, it was the perfect ending to a great meal.  This place gets 5 starts all the way, from the moment we walked in, the service was impeccable and the food was superb.  Thank you FnB|1
Decided to give this place a chance and was quite delighted. I am vegan and that's an issue sometimes. I tried the vegetable chow mein(medium spicy) and I love it. I get extra broccoli and there is so much flavor in the veggies and noodles. My husband has tried the General Tso's chicken, The BBQ pork chow mein, the mu shu pork and the garlic chicken and he loved them all. The great thing is that this is a family run business and it shows in the food. I highly recommend at least trying this place. it's reasonably priced and there are great lunch specials during the week.|1
DECEMBER 2012:They still have the ANGRY WHOPPER!!!!! Best whopper EVER. Mine goes no lettuce, heavy onion, heavy tomato, and BBQ sauce on the bottom bun. It's THICK.  55 year anniversary --- second whopper 55 cents! DEAL!!!  Really, have you ever had a BAD whopper? :)|1
Sauce is my kind of place.  Great, inexpensive food, casual yet trendy atmosphere, perfect location.    Located right by Urban Outfitters and Olive and Ivy at the Scottsdale Waterfront, I like Sauce as a pre or post shopping bonanza meal.  I always have the same thing: the mozzarella and tomato salad (which you should know is mostly greens with chucks of each, drizzled in balsamic), and the artichoke and portabella pizza.  This is a huge meal so I always have leftovers which make for the perfect 2am after-bar treat.    If youre feeling particularly saucey, you can have yourself a glass of wine as well.|1
I love this place.  The first time I went, I had my mom and my sister with me.  We all got pedicures and by far the best foot massages I've had at any of these nail places.  The thing that really impresses me the most is that after only one visit... the next time I came in- they greeted me by my name. How often does that happen?  Hello, customer service- welcome back.  It's husband and wife owned and operated and they are as nice as can be. Love it here.  Great atmosphere, friendly, good service, affordable.  You won't be disappointed.|1
I have been here a few times but have to remember to come here more often.   I LOVE it!   I've never made it past the refrigerated and prepared foods section, but who needs to! You can find everything you need right there.   The meat section is beautiful to look at, they have a whole section of prepared heat and eat dinners, side, soups, sauces etc. grab a premade one or grab a few ingredients and make your own!   My favorite so far would be the Tub of Alfredo sauce, package of fresh pasta, and package of chicken breast strips ..YUM!  Dinner in 20 anyone? ;-)  Their Tomato basil soup is Amazing too!!   I scored dinner for 3 last night for ......$7!!!!  2 packages of their heat and eat mac and cheese and 2 packages of Tilapia, all ready and in about 10 minutes!   Seriously if you are trying to save money and still want to eat good, fresh and easy food then this your place!|1
Holy AMAZING.  I went here this past Saturday for a baby shower in one of the private dining rooms and was absolutely blown away by the food.  We had a spread which included Mac & Cheese, Sliders, Chopped Salad, some bread and french fries.  I'm still thinking about those sliders and the french fries.  I can't WAIT to go back and order from the full menu.   As is par for the Sam Fox course; the decor is over the top.  I need to find out who designs these places and have them make over my house!|1
Stay in the courtyard recently and have no complaints at all!! RIght when I entered the place , the staff greeted us and they were all very nice and helpful with everything. Although i only stayed there for 1 night , i thought the rooms were very well kept and the bed was amazing! The first thing i do when i check into the room is look at the bed and sample how if feels and this bed was amazing! The rooms are about normal size and has a tv , desk , chair , etc..... Wifi is also a must whenever i travel and no complaints here. Wifi was fast and easily available. Did not have a chance to see the gym or the pool but they do have one. Overall , i would stay here again if i come by Phoenix!!|1
"OK, so this is how much I love this product. I first tasted Lee's at a Yelp Elite event and waited and dreamed a whole year to eat it again. When I was invited to the next year's Elite Pleydate it was the topic of the first question out of my mouth. ""Is Lee's gonna be there?"" ( Ok, maybe the whole French restaurant's Bone Marrow gravy came to mind too, but I digress) When I made it inside to Pleydate I literally ran to that booth having desert before dinner. I am all about the alcohol infused ice cream now. The funny thing about that is I am not even a big ice cream lover. I will have to visit the shop soon."|1
These guys are great.  I had an old Craftsman mower, probably 8yo, that even sat unused in a basement for a couple years.  It coughed and wheezed, barely even turning over.  I brought it to them and now it works (and even looks) brand new!|1
My wife and I absolutely love this place.  Yes, it's a bit pricier... but yu get what you pay for: excellent food and service!  The patio is even cigar-friendly, which is a huge plus for us!  We visit often!|1
Great multigrain sandwiches. Nice patio too!|1
Had the mahi and it was great.  Very reasonably priced also.  Definitely a repeat.|1
Best Cakes around!  This may sound crazy, but I've never actually been in this place.  But I've tried so many different things they have.    My job goes through Karsh's for all the anniversary cakes, catering, and special events.  We get cookies, cakes, and other assorted pieces of heaven from Karsh's.  Recently, my coworkers wanted to try something different.  They got an eclaire, cake balls, and mini rainbow cakes.  The rainbow cakes are the best thing to ever go in my mouth.  I could eat those for days.  They just melt in your mouth plus they're covered with chocolate.  What?  Yes!  My friends also got me a Karsh's cake for my birthday a few years ago.  I wish I had a picture of it.  It was so pretty with a butterfly on it.  And it tasted amazing.  Though I've never been a paying customer and I've never walked through their door, I love this place and highly recommend it for any event you may be throwing.|1
Guacamole was best I've had!|1
Love.  It.  Awesome pulled pork, brisket, turkey.  The sides are really good, too.  I feel like it's somewhat expensive, but it's worth every bite, but then again, that's BBQ.  If it's dirt cheap, that means it's not quality meat.  Anyway, the 2-pound potato is great, too -- chives, sour cream, butter....|1
This place is great! If you talk to anybody they have a suggestion for a great flavor. You can bring in food from another place to enjoy and just enjoy a great atmosphere. With the music that someone has an issue with you can just talk to the DJ to get a suggestion they are MORE than accommodating. They have a great happy hour prices!  Overall great prices, great people, and a great time! If you have the right mind :)|1
Super cool, cookie/cake.chocolate maker haven!  :)  Totally worth the 40 minute drive I had - it was packed when I got there and I did not experience one little bit of rudeness.  I arrived with my 5yo and after cruising the aisles for a bit an employee came by to see if I needed help finding anything.  Super neat place!  :)|1
Amazing bagels and a great staff. I always get the build your bagel sandwich it's heaven!|1
I was sad to come back to lai lai's and they no longer had the Mongolian :( boo,, but i took my mom there and we were starving so we decided to order off the menu. My mom is allergic to  msg and they helped us with what we should order. and she didn't get sick!! woo hoo.. we ordered three dishes and an appetizer to share between her , my bf, and myself, and we stilll brought food home, and I dont think we spent over $30 bucks for all that food!! it was very good to! i love good cheap food!! Ill be back, they are always friendly.|1
This isn't your typical Mexican restaurant that puts cheese and sour cream on everything. The food here is light, simple, and fresh. We started out with the guacamole which was amazing. My sister doesn't even like mandarin oranges but it tasted so good in the guacamole she was eating it like it was going out of style. The salsa that came with it was the bomb. One was a spicy red salsa and the other one was a tomatillo salsa. The green one was so good I wanted to drink it. I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my sister ordered a couple of tacos with rice and beans. Everything tasted great and I even had room for dessert after my meal. We had some kind of carmel, banana, crepe thing. It doesn't look like much but it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Gallo Blanco is my new obsession.|1
"i think this food is phenomenal. this was the first place i tried asian food in AZ when moving out here years ago. it has grown since then and the food is always top notch.   for a late sunday afternoon lunch, the place was nearly empty but their takeout counter was constantly busy. our server was friendly and attentive and kept our water glass filled.   it's been a while since i ate for the review for which i write so i don't remember exactly what it was, but it had the big, wide rice noodles which i love. i do remember that the dish was excellent and big enough to supply leftovers for lunch the next day.  they ask how spicy and i've eaten thai food ""spicy"" and it is downright dangerous, so we opted for ""medium"" with a side of spice juice...which was HOT!  we will continue to patronize Tottie's as they are consistent and the food and service has always been very, very, very good. and very reasonable prices."|1
This was the first real ballet I have ever been to, and I was so excited it was the Nutcracker! I have been wanting to see the Nutcracker for years.   Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp, I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning. When I walked in, I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated, a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures. The bartenders we bought our drinks from, was very friendly and accomodating.   I can't say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers, the sets, the costumes, etc. Just incredible. I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season....|1
Ahhh Shady's...I am a little embarrassed to admit how often I frequent this gem of a place, but definitely not ashamed of how much I love it.  Cool atmosphere, just the right lighting (very important to me), great bartenders, good prices on a really nice selection (Who else has Old Raj gin or Agwa De Bolivia?).   This is definitely not a dive bar (not that there's anything wrong with that), but it's not an icey, blase Snobbsdale-ish joint either, and I've never felt ridiculed or snubbed here either by patron or bartender.  I've seen all walks of life come through this place, but never felt that it was too 'hip' or pretentious in any way. Great jukebox, obscure, forgotten movies playing on the telly, bartenders that are nice to look at (male and female), have personality and actually remember your name (and drink).  Does it get any better than this?|1
The Menu here is great.  So much to choose from and its always good.  No mater which location we visit our service is always good and we never have to wait long to be seated.  The Jambalaya is a big favorite, and the pizza here is awesome.  I've also noticed that they have improved the drink menu quite a bit|1
I am in love with the cinema suite! Being able to stretch out your legs on the LazyBoy recliner is the way to enjoy the movie. The chair is spacious and the room is not crowded with viewers.  The foods are at a reasonable price and the server is nice. For movie that are 2+ hours long, watching movie on the recliner is the best experience. Also great place to go on a date :)|1
I think everyone has said most everything that needs to be said about this place. But I'll highlight the reasons I frequent Switch...  free wi-fi good drinks $5 recession plate special - that is always as awesome as the rest of their menu good happy hour specials open til 11pm 7 days a week good wine  great/friendly wait staff  their salads are out of control - amazing.  i think i could happily support/invest in switch/fez/ticoz dynasty for all of eternity...if i had the means.|1
Whenever I start leaning toward being a vegetarian like my daughter is, I remember the smell and taste of that scrumptious, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon at Durant's. And the hot fudge sundae for dessert? Dang, just can't beat it. The bartenders are old school--not too aloof, not fawning, just professional and classy. The best.|1
As a vegetarian with a fairly adventurous palate, I love Ethiopian food. And now that I work in northern Tempe, I'm here all the time. It's filling, flavorful and inexpensive. I can have a pretty big dinner for less than $10. If you, like me, think spiced (though not particularly spicy) vegetables are the greatest things on Earth, definitely pay a visit to Blue Nile.|1
The obsession started about 2 yrs ago and I haven't looked back since... Started with getting them catered for lunch, then a trip here or there to the restaurant. SO. GOOD. The bread is amazing, but the love, sweat, tears and what ever else they pop in there is addicting. Hmmm, now I am wondering what it is they put in there?? Anyway, I won't think too long and hard about that one. But tomorrow I'm definitely heading back for the Vermonter, gotta feed the addiction.|1
"If you like P.F. Changs, you will love Pei Wei! It's essentially the same thing in a less formal dining setting, & Take-Out! I can't tell a difference between their Orange Chicken, or the lettuce wraps minus the price tag!!! My favorite dish here is the Dan-Dan Noodles! (It's Hot. Spicy, & Pure Indulgence Pleasure for under $10!!!)  If you have not heard; ""Pei Wei is not authentic Asian food!"" Well neither is Panda Express, but I'll tell you Pei Wei is better than Panda Express & most Authentic Asian restaurants in the US!  Yes I said most Authentic Asian restaurants! (NO MSG!)  ""Can you believe the balls on this guy!?""  We'll I have had Chinese food in China Towns in San Francisco, LA, NY, Vancouver & Dallas! I've even had Peking Duck in Hong Kong; don't be impressed it was not that good! I love Chinese food, but I really love Asian Fusion! Roy's, PF Changs, & Pei Wei really wet my noodle!  The other nice thing about Pei Wei is their take out!  I have them on speed dial... So when I'm on my way home from work I'll call, & as I pull in I pay, pick up, and go! It's freshly cooked & No Wait!!!"|1
At length: A trip to Kauai for our friends' wedding several years back led us to Puka Dog and the discovery of another type of holy matrimony: the perfect union of frankfurters and tropical fruit. Our friends are still together eight years later, but how my hot dogs have longed for the companionship of a little pineapple and banana relish.  Disconsolate from my long lost love, I have abstained from the hot dog community (except for Ted's, because it's amazing and what happens in Tempe, stays in Tempe) until a new beau arrived: Maui Dog.  In short (ish): Yummy, yummy, yummy, I've got Maui Dog in my tummy. I tried the Sweet & Spicy Dog (favorite!!!) and the Lava Dog (messy!!!) and the house made fries. Everything was delish, and I'll be back to try the rest. The restaurant is a cute, clean, pseudo-dive (kind of a Two Hippies vibe) with a few tables inside and a dog-friendly patio (tee-hee). It's funky and it's affordable. Go ahead, try it. You just might fall in love.|1
CASH ONLY!  But we easily feed a family of 4 hungry people for less than $20 and it's not Taco Bell.  So with that being said... the Grilled Pork #5 sandwich... oh hell ya... it's good ringing in at only $2.85.  The regular Turkey / Ham on a crossaint is about $4.25 and it's the size of a small football... great value... you could probalby get by with the small croissant sandwich instead for  only $1.95... yeah... it's crazy cheap.  Hot wings are generic prebreaded with a kick of spiciness.   The steamed bun is sweet dough..however, not my favorite... my husband and sister seem to love the egg and meat inside.  The ice cream is all homemade...also another great deal at $.99 cents for a cone... check out the icecream...looks crazy good.  Don't miss out on taking home some baked goods... the baguettes are crusty-soft and warm when you get them.  The croissants are delicious and some of the better ones here in the valley.  I did try and Avacodo boba...had to send it back...not sure what the heck it was...it was green... but didn't taste anything like Avacado... so I did head across the way to Boba tea house for my bobas.  The Viet coffee, also great kick for you mentally if you need a boost, very strong=very good.  Don't miss out on this place... it's a good go to place for a great lunch or snack.|1
I can't believe I haven't yelped about the place yet. Several months (maybe over a year?) ago my husband read a newspaper article about the Clover coffee maker and the one place in town that had managed to procure one. I was skeptical (as is my nature). It can't be that much better right? You're just saying it's amazing because you want to talk about the new hot coffee shop you discovered, right? Well, maybe. But I love this place. And I don't think it has a whole lot to do with the Clover. They roast their own beans and they roast them way differently than that other ginormous coffee chain - all a light or medium roast. Never bitter, never oily, never yucky. The coffee they make there is, obviously, the best. But I send my husband in every week now to buy a pound of beans so that I can approximate the same coffee at home. Add an edgy (though sometimes intimidating) seating area, great local art (which we bought off the wall), and smiley service...I'm sold. Can't wait to try out the downtown location.|1
Went here before a Phx Suns game. DELICIOUS! Everything on the menu looked amazing. I forgot what it was called, but the open-faced steak sandwich was my favorite! All the dishes were even presented nicely! Will definitely eat here again!|1
One of the most impressive spots in town.   Lunch here is a luxury experience - the grounds are amazingly beautiful, and the menu surprisingly affordable. Try this for an inexpensive way to really impress a business client.  For dinner they will take your shorts, though it is certainly worth it if you desire a truly memorable, elegant evening. Life is too short - try this restaurant soon!  I have yet to stay here (Royal Palms hotel) - but it is definitely on my list of 1001 things to do before I expire.|1
I am being generous with my review. I am biased since this place has been one of my favorite restaurants for years. I love it in Georgia and this place continues the tradition of rocking faces off - Italian style.   I went to this locale for my birthday party with about 20 friends (unbelievable, I know). This place was more than accommodating. The waitress was fantastic, even though we were a pain in the butt come check time. I took her suggestions for our family style dinner and not one disappointed. I highly recommend the Rigatoni D and Chicken Prosciutto. Both were fantastic entrees. To top it off, we finished out with killer tiramisu.   There is nothing bad I can say for this place. The atmosphere is what you would  expect from a large italian restaurant. I personally love that their waiting area is also the bar. That is just good thinking. It truly is a killer place that is perfectly nestled in north Scottsdale. I am in love...|1
"Umm this place is awesome. I got a bike basket for 25 cents. 25 cents! Too often these days I run into ""thrift"" stores that miss the thrifty part, but not this one! It's fun to shop and you may end up finding a truly good deal!"|1
"We enrolled our son in this program. It was EXCELLENT! Of our three children who have learned to drive we have observed that he is the most safety conscious and the best ""new"" licensed driver.  Thank you, Driving MBA, for the peace of mind you have given us."|1
My boyfriend and I went to Film Bar last night to see Iron Sky. Neither of us had been there before, and the decision was made quickly, so we had no idea what to expect. The bartender was incredibly nice, friendly, informative, and genuine. The prices for the bar were very reasonable, and I thought that $7 for tickets was MORE than reasonable. We were there more than an hour early, and it was so nice to just sit back on the low booths and chat.  I gotta admit, I totally fell in love with this little place, and I can't wait to go back!  My ONLY concern is that by the time our movie was done, there was a DJ playing music so loudly that you could hear it in the theater and you couldn't talk without shouting in the bar, so we had to go outside to converse with our friends. I would bet that the place doesn't have a DJ all the time, though.|1
Really delicious breakfast burritos! They are true Mexican-style! I get the ham and egg breakfast burrito and it comes with cheese and a fresh tortilla. They are inexpensive and really big! I'm so glad I work a mile from this place! I go at least once a week!|1
Excellent. Fresh and yummy!|1
I love this gym! Everyone is so helpful and friendly. The gym has a TON of equipment and is always very well kept and clean. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else. I feel very well connected to all of the staff - they even know me by name! The trainers are extremely helpful also. I would recommend this gym to anyone and everyone!|1
Love it! The food is VERY spicy though.  Luckily, I have burned off all of my taste buds so far from all my mexican food endeavors, however, the wussies out there should take note :)  Just realize that this place is VERY small and can get VERY crowded.  I was there once and George W Bush came in to eat there.  Evidently he loves the food.|1
Amazing thrift store! The owner was extremely kind and polite to me so I'm not too sure why one reviewer was saying he was rude. They had baskets of clothes out front that were free for homeless or needy people which I thought was great considering places like goodwill often overcharge for clothing that should be donated to those in need. Great find on a Robert cavalli jacket and J.crew pants that were literally like new. Prices were completely reasonable for quality second hand clothing. For sure will go back!!!|1
I am a huge fan of Saigon Nites. A friend and I regularly eat here (once weekly) and we have NEVER had a bad experience. The Steak Pho is amazing. Typically when I Have Pho I load it up with hot sauces, chili oil, etc...not at Saigon! Their Pho is ready to rock and roll the second it leaves the kitchen. Two thumbs way up!|1
How could you write a bad review about a mountain?  Great sight to see.|1
"I absolutely LOVE Club SAR! I joined back in 2010 (I think...). At first, I just went there with my ex (who lived in So Cal and had been boxing) because I have always loved the sport of boxing and wanted to get into it myself (maybe even join the boxing team).  Sadly, I exceeded the age limit to join the boxing team, by a few years...  :-( But, at least I could still learn and get fit.  :-) We just walked up to the entrance and just took one quick look around and it seemed crowded and small so we were not impressed. So, we left. I found out this used to be just a boxing gym before but eventually they added other classes and equipment for others to enjoy.   Glad I went back later on my own and found out how affordable it was! I checked and tried a few other Fitness centers and gyms nearby but, when I decided to actually try one of Club SAR's boxing classes, I was hooked! For a mere $3  (a day) drop-by fee, I was able to get one of the best workouts I ever had. I joined after I found out it only cost $75 for the whole YEAR which includes ALL the classes I can take (Boxing, boxing conditioning, Yoga, spin class, kickboxing, weight training, MMA... Yes! MMA too, which I personally love.  :-) ). Jonathan & Carlos are great and so is Tom. They're funny, friendly, and they actually remember you after only a few classes.  The pricing has gone up this year but it is still by far, the BEST possible deal you can find anywhere in the Valley.   Fees    YEARLY Membership  Resident    Non-Resident  Adult (18+ years)       $99                  $150  Child (14-17 years)    $50                  $75  Daily Drop-In Fee $3 Residents; $5 Non-Residents   If you are serious about getting fit, staying in shape and getting a good old-fashioned workout without all the ""posing"" and pretentiousness of other gyms which are more like ""meeting places"" and ""meat markets"" for the young Scottsdale wannabes, this gym is definitely for you!  Personally, I recommend the boxing classes because they will kick your butt, they are fun, get you fit and, in shape. :-) They just got new heavy bags so there are 2 heavy bags, 1 hooks bag, several ""Bob bags"", 2- double-ended bags and 3 speed bags in the main workout areas. Plus, a bunch more standing weighted-base heavy bags in the other ""kickboxing/Yoga room. And, in case you didn't notice from the picture, a full-size boxing ring.  Yes. I am totally endorsing this gym!   P.S. This is a ""no frills"", serious gym.  So, no whinnying and crying. Suck it up and do some push-ups!  ;-)  Call them for more details:  (480) 312-2669"|1
Fantastic find for delicious, healthy food and good service!!   A local friend said that they'd heard good things but hadn't been yet. They asked us to check it out., so we went for a late lunch mid-week and it was still jam packed (30 minute wait) at 1:30 p.m.. We sat at the bar and received terrific service. The fish tacos, steak tacos, bison burger and desserts were all delicious.  It is an open-air style restaurant where you can see into the kitchen. All ingredients are super fresh and the culinary quality is extremely high given that they can make even the healthiest things taste wonderful. I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a healthy food alternative.|1
I had to do some painting and needed help locating items and suggestions from the staff and boy were they ever helpful.  Nothing like Home Depot, where you have to go and hunt down an employee and when you do they can't wait to get back to their break or whatever was more important than their customer.  I was just overwhelmed by the courteous and quick service I received at this location.  Even their quality of garden plants surpassed several other super stores.|1
"All I can say is ""yum!"""|1
"It's 1961 and we're having lunch in the courtyard of our Miami Beach hotel. Parker House rolls, sweet and salty, an open-face meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy. There's a surf board and a tiki carving amidst the flowers. But wait - something's wrong!! There's no humidity! Those are imported mushrooms in my gravy! I work to orient myself in time and space and find, what a relief, that I'm actually in Cafe ZuZu in downtown Scottsdale and it's 2010.   The Valley Ho Resort, which houses the Cafe, is such a wonderful period piece. It opened in 1956 and was renovated in 2005 by a very wise design team that left the mid-century architecture and spirit intact. Cafe ZuZu is at the far end of the lobby, and its charming patio is surrounded with flowers. The decor is late 50's. If you're as old as we are, you'll recognize it instantly. The menu consists of ""Flavorful American comfort food. Familiar favorites with a contemporary twist."" There are goodies like warm Maytag blue cheese fondue ($7.50), truffled grilled cheese ($9), beef stroganoff ($17), and (gross) tuna salad with cottage cheese which brings me back to my childhood a little too clearly.   While waiting for our entrees, we received a basket of Parker House rolls. These are the nice squishy white bread treats that, if you can manage not to eat them all, make wonderful toys. You can mold them into sculptures, or shape them into little round beebees to shoot through your straw. My meatloaf sandwich ($11.25) was served on a thick piece of grilled white bread topped first with melty cheese, then the meatloaf, then the gravy. There was a mound of lumpless mashed potatoes alongside. They were so smooth Ken wondered if they were made from instant, but they tasted much too good for that. The portion was huge, I took half home (of course I knew I was going to have dessert). Ken had sauteed liver, beautifully prepared, atop a mound of kale that had been cooked with high quality bacon, sauced with a Madera reduction. He loved it. I surprised him by ordering a lemon meringue tart ($6) for us to share. There were several chocolate desserts that sounded good, but I had a vision of the mile high meringue toppings of my childhood. The tart had only modest swirls of meringue, but it had been made in such a way that it was creamy, as opposed to foamy, and it was really good.The lemon custard was the star. I remembered a gelatinous filling, but this was smooth and velvety, with just the right tart/sweet balance. The pastry was a cross between cookie and pie crust, and stood up well to the filling.   This was not an inexpensive meal, but the portions are large and quality is excellent. Plus we had joined an organization called The Lunch Club, which every weekday, emails it's members a discount coupon for a restaurant in their specified zip code. So one of our entrees was free! (The discount coupons differ, some are 20% off the bill, others merely are for a free drink). But, to pay Cafe ZuZu the ultimate compliment - I'd come here and pay full price."|1
what is it with me and pricey phoenix hotels? i swear i don't just give out fives willy nilly or do i have any particular adoration for phoenix.  (sorry phx.)   I went to the Valley Ho on an amazing business trip that involved rock stars and the Oakland Athletics, which happen to be my favorite team. it was downright magical.   the decor was fantastic, the rooms were huge, with huge tubs, a poolside patio and a comfy chaise lounge. the flatscreen TV had an iPod doc! yaaaaay! (why don't more hotels do this?)   the pool was phenomenal. i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody mary's and frozen drinks. the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust.   The trader vic's attached isn't so hot, but i generally liked all the food i got from the pool bar and the restaurant ZuZus. (room service too- they make their own english muffins!!!)  If i'm comparing it to the royal palms, the other phoenix resort i raved about, it's tough. Royal Palms is better for chilling and families; Valley Ho is better for singles. Royal Palms is your wedding; Valley Ho the bachelorette party. Valley Ho had better food and more style, but Royal Palms had a bit more to it and better service. Really, you can't go wrong with either.   What is it about Phoenix hotels??? all i know is i am no longer groaning when i'm sent on a business trip there!|1
Definitely one of my favorite places to eat, hands down.  I love their enchiladas verdes combo.  Their refried beans are THE BEST!  I have been eating here for over 15 years and the waitresses are mostly the same.  Definitely feels like you are at an old friends house when you are there.  Yes, it is in a bad area, but that hasn't ever deterred me from telling everyone I know that if they want really good, real Mexican food at a great price, to head down there.  And their green salsa for dipping chips is amazing.|1
This is a true gem! I took my dog there after bouncing around trying to find the right groomer for him. I read the reviews and gave this place a try. I was really happy with the customer service, the service performed on my dog, the fact I got a same day appt, and most importantly....my dog did not seem to be anxious or uncomfortable. He normally leaves a groomer stressed and not himself, but he seemed to be at complete ease here!|1
This is my favorite breakfast & lunch place in Ahwatukee. The food is excellent. The service is friendly and they do what they do perfectly. This isn't a place to go for elegant sit down service. It's the perfect blend of self-service meets top restaurant quality food.   Have the Croque Monsieur--or add an egg to make it a Croque Madame. You will not be disappointed. The bread and the baked goods are so good you could make a substantial meal off them alone.  Finally, this is a small local business that truly cares about its community. They have shown up at two community fund raising events with huge boxes of warm, freshly baked cookies to donate. I'm grateful to have a place of this caliber in my neighborhood.|1
"Just had my first hot dog at Short Leash Dogs and quite honestly, I can't call it a ""hot dog"" because that just conjures up images of, well... a hot dog. And Short Leash Dogs are so much more and better than ""a hot dog"" the way most people know hot dogs. Know what I mean? No? Well, go have a Short Leash Dog.   Really unique combinations, various dog options (all local meats and produce) - bratwurst, beer hot, veggie...   My friend and I shared an Aiko (we chose the brat as our dog), with mango chutney, red onions, cilantro, mayo and jalapeño on a naan (you might have read that in other reviews, no traditional buns here!).   You can find the Short Leash Dogs truck at the Phoenix Public Market on Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings, and if you follow them on Twitter (@shortleashdogs) you can find out when/where else they make regular stops... scottsdale, central phoenix... Track 'em down and eat their food. And talk to them - Brad and Kat are smart enthusiastic folks with a great sense of humor and offer superb food and service! What's not to love?"|1
My wife turned me on to this gem. Her family has been eating here since the 70's it never disappoints. The machaca is moist not wet like many others. The Pepsi from the fountain is the best fountain soda anywhere.|1
"Really?  Because it doesn't get any better than this.  For what it is and for what it's worth this place is truly unique.  A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.  What is a pasty?  A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the ""handles"" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.  At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.  Pros * Good food * Originality * Portions * Customer service * Coat hooks at the bar  Cons * Small interior"|1
Tanzy, Yelp, and Lindsey deserve the biggest standing O for this event.    I honestly think I am still full from the generous food options that kept flowing.  I kept thinking we were done, but OH NO here comes another course.  I felt like I was at a chef tasting menu dinner.    Right when we got there we had a glass of Champagne and were seated with a olive and meat plate followed by some bruschetta and local made cheese.  After the event officially started we were hit with amazing course after amazing course.  With never empty glasses of wine    My Favs:  Sweet Corn Risotto  Scallops (cooked to perfection with a parsnip puree mmmmmmmm)  Alaskan King Salmon  Center Cut Filet Mignon  Brussel Sprouts yes Brussel Sprouts (Tempura battered with a sweet relish AMAZING)  4 hour braised beef short rib (Talk about melt in your mouth)    Red Velvet Bread Pudding (I will go back just for this anytime I am near the Quarter)  I can't wait to go back to Tanzy for a full meal but I don't know how I will be able to top this evening of amazing food.    I was very surprised to hear they have been open for 2 years as I was really blown away with their food and service.    Thanks again to everyone who helped put together this amazing event what a great way to end 2012.|1
Amazing selection of beers with great tabs educating you on them and often ratings.  Wine and booze selections are great too.  Killer store like candyland for adults.  Prices are excellent and so is service if you need help finding something.  Great place!|1
I visited this place in January while I was in Phoenix and I miss the food! My vegan friend suggested this place to me and my other friend (we were skeptical that vegan food could taste good)...she proved us wrong!  The food here was delicious, I'd eat here regularly if I lived in Phoenix! When we arrived, we were worried about the hours since we got there pretty close to closing time, but they were cool! We shared the samosas and buffalo wings for appetizers. I ordered the Thai Peanut bowl with mock chicken and noodles for my entree. I felt like everything was flavored well and while I enjoy meat normally, this opened my mind to trying other vegetarian places in the future. I liked the ambiance here, great place to grab a bite with friends and chill. It was the perfect place to stop by after a busy weekend! I'll be back next time I'm in the area.|1
Their frozen drinks carried me through last summer. They have free air (for your tires) and water (for the radiator) at every location I've ever been to. Their hot sandwiches, though greasy, aren't TOO greasy and actually taste like food. The coffee is pretty good, and they have more ways to tart it up than Starbucks does. QT frickin' rocks.  And BTW, the QT stands for Quick Trip.|1
This place is fantastic.  About the restaurant itself.  It's right by downtown Phoenix, and in fact right next to a Light Rail stop--so keep this in mind, parking is metered and sometimes hard to come by easily, if you live by a light rail this may be the smarter option.  The place is seriously tiny, only about 6-8 groups of people can be seated at one time.  A slight drawback is that there is limited outdoor seating, which, given the predictably large lines even on weekdays, is a problem.  The Phoenix sun will make a 45 minute wait seem like an hour and a half wait.  Now about the service.  I've always had a good experience with the people who work here.  The first time I came here, apparently one of the owners saw that I looked lost, because she came out and very kindly explained how people are seated, where I can go to get coffee in the meantime.  She even suggested I leave my cell phone number and she'll call me when my seat is ready, in case I'm shopping for example.  The waitresses always serve us quickly and never leave us hanging, and they're always smiling, which for some reason makes the experience so much better.  Now for the best part.  I swear, they put crack in their food, because although their breakfast options are simple, they are out of this world.  The first time I came here I got the waffles.  Perhaps it's because they use REAL maple syrup, or all of the ingredients are organic and locally grown, but they make the best waffles I've ever had.  I don't even know how one makes a good waffle really, it seems pretty formulaic, but it's stellar.  I ordered it with bacon, which was also wonderful--the bacon used was the good stuff, not the excessively fatty bacon you buy at the supermarket.  Every bite is spectacular, and when you're done, you're full, but not the kind of full you'll often get at breakfast joints where you think you're going to explode or take a nap--full, but refreshed.  The second time I came I got the pancakes.  Not the best pancake I've ever had, but still, superb and the real maple syrup just sends it through the roof.  The third time I went I got the waffle again (see above).  Before I came here, I was excited about leaving Phoenix for New York due to the incredible array of dining options you get in that city.  Now I'm worried there won't be anything as good!|1
Stingray Sushi is where we go for sushi .  Sleek ,beautiful interior and very ,very clean ! This dining house has large 13 or so foot doors that when open ,seamlessly link the patio potion with the interior dining area ,a very good design flow,indeed. The patio itself is very comfortable as it has great seating . The service has always been wonderful ,the sushi very fresh with beautiful presentation .We like to get the sushi boat , edamame ,and beef yakitori.The fire dragon rolls( though on the small side) are also yummy.  Drinks are very good here ..the sinful orchid (yum)a very pretty drink .And their HH is really good as well .|1
An organized & clean store, a well educated & nice staff, a great selection of baby/kid products! I will never go to a babies r us again. Thank you Chandler buybuybaby!|1
"Fresh.  Tasty.  Interesting.  Good ""People Watching.""  Love everything I have tried here.  The Happy Hour ""tapas"" are excellent.  My daughter could not get enough of the garlic chicken one.  The 3-bean plate is delish - kinda like ""meatless chili"" but you don't miss the meat.     The fruit salad is massive and the fruit served with it is completely top-notch.  Wait staff is mostly cute college girls, which is hardly ever a completely bad thing.  Never had a problem with good, attentive service, which CAN be a problem sometimes.  I go eat there as often as is reasonable.  Highly Recommended."|1
Just had takeout from here. Amazing as always!!! Had the carne asada torta. DDelish!!!!|1
Amazing Mexican food and the drinks are knock you on your ass good.  Have the guacamole and a madre then come and talk to me.|1
Oregano's is my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Tempe! The food is delicious - I've never been disappointed by a single appetizer, entrée or desert! And since they've recently add Blue Moon beer on draft I could stay here on the patio all day. Bonus: The wait staff is incredibly fun and friendly. Just a really great place to dine!|1
I've been going here many years.  The food is always very, very good. Soups are fantastic, sandwiches are hearty and flavorful, and the service is excellent. Prices are reasonable and the food quality and quantity is probably the best bang for the $ you'll get in a place like this, anywhere I've been - and I travel a lot.  I really cannot think of a single thing I can fault this place for.|1
Hands-down my favorite pizza place in the East Valley.  I have been going to Sourdough pizza for close to 15 years, and it is consistently delicious.  I grew up in Mesa, now live in Phoenix, but I make it a point to visit Sourdough Pizza when I am in the Mesa area.  The decor definitely leaves something to be desired, as they are in a stucco strip mall, and their interior probably has not been updated  all that much in the 15 years I've been there.  But I could care less when the food and prices are this good.|1
Amazing sandwhich joint. A must go place to eat!|1
Once we went to Grimaldi's in Hoboken, NJ and weren't all that impressed.  Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldi's, we were blown away!    Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.  When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.    There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.  There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.  Everytime we're in AZ, it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldi's!|1
I went to Kens Nails on Tatum a couple weeks ago and finally found my go-to nail place! The staff was friendly and helpful and it's a nicely decorated spa. I went in to get a mani/pedi and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of service. Mandy was my manicurist and she was wonderful. I got the gel nail manicure which was only $30 and the spa pedi which was only $32 and amazing! I am looking forward to going back.|1
"I was so happy when I saw this chain appear in AZ.  I used to frequent it in CA and have never found another sub that comes close.    I think the secret to their success lies in the freshness and quality of their meats and cheeses - always sliced to order.  If you are looking for a veggie sandwich - you will be limited here.  But, if you like a hearty cheesesteak or italian sub you are in for a treat.  They also take a bit of a different approach in that they really douse their sandwiches in oil & vinegar.   It is a different approach but seriously good!  The ""Mike's Way"" option (lettuce, onions & tomatoes) is a bit bland, I love to add the mustard, mayo & pepperocini.  Their signature sandwich is the #13.  It has several flavorful italian meats plus freshly sliced cheese.  Don't judge this place until you have tried that sandwich!  It is unlike any other chain's offering & really amazing.    Their sandwich sizes are a bit different from the regular foot-long, but if you order the largest size you are getting quite a bit for your money.  I've visited the one that just opened in Chandler and was completely pleased.  And, I'm happy to hear they are now opening one in Ahwatukee.  They also seem to have a high focus on customer service - I've always been met by very cheerful, helpful people.  Not a necessity for a sandwich, but certainly a lot better than the opposite."|1
"We held a meeting planner's luncheon inviting local clients to our hotel that host regular meetings.  Our theme was ""getting to the core of your meeting"" and the entire event had an apple theme.  Yuri's Popcorn created a special flavor green apple for our event and it was a nice compliment to our other offerings.  Our attendees absolutely loved it and were excited about all the creative and delicious offerings, including centerpieces with an arrangement of candies and popcorn beautifully arranged into a bouquet of yumminess.  Several months ago, we hosted a lemonade stand for a client serving glasses of flavored lemonade.  Yuri's created another fun flavor....lemon....that was well received by all.  They offer the perfect gifts for clients and everything is very affordable when you're on a tight budget.  Thank you!"|1
I was hoping to be the first to review Grayhawk Family Chiropractic, but I'm glad to see Heather feels the same way I do about them.  Dr. Frank Sorrentino is a true professional. I've suffered from low back issues for years and Dr. Frank always knows how to treat the problem. Between regular visits and the website they set you up with to demonstrate stretches tailored to your condition I'm glad to report I've been in good shape for a while.  Whether you have an ongoing issue or have just injured yourself Grayhawk Family Chiropractic is the place to go.|1
Hubbard Family Swim School has become a staple for our family. You can feel the warmth and dedication on every visit. Our kids love it and are excited to come to every lesson. We even have birthday parties here!  The instruction is top-notch and it's evident while watching through the huge glass wall.  Most of all, my 5 year old is a much better swimmer than I am, his father. Thanks to Hubbard.|1
You know, for a goodwill this one really isn't bad!  They have a ton of clothes that are actually displayed to make them look orderly and clean instead of the usual crammed heaps and stacks you see.  I love the books - a great selection of books you have always meant to read (and I don't mean the old classics, though they have those too) like James Patterson, Anne Rice, and all those gooey Twilight books.  Looks like they moved out most of the furniture recently, but perhaps they will be getting a new shipment soon.  Lots of knick-knacks and vases, and about 25 printers to choose from!  Check here first if you are looking for one of the above stated items - they is a good chance you will find it!|1
Excellent! I love this place!|1
Always good food and good service. Best gyros around. I know I always get speedy service so I can eat my food and not be there for hours.|1
Don't let the slightly sketchy neighborhood put you off.  Baiz market has some of the best food in town.  The small deli (cafe?  Not sure what to call it) located in the market has all of the staples such as shwarma and falafel.  the prices are cheap, The service is snappy and friendly, and the food is exceptional, especially considering the price.  Wash down your meal with any one of many exotic drinks (or, just choose a diet coke) in the beverage cooler.  Even if you've stuffed yourself silly, wander on back to the bakery.  The assortment of traditional Middle Eastern sweets can't be matched anywhere in town.  Come early and wander around in the market to pick up your selection of hard to find ingredients.|1
THis place is great! I need an adjustment every now and then but I live in Scottsdale and my regular Chiropractor is so good that he is always booked up ahead of time, so if I tweek my back unexpectedly I can't get in soon enough quite often. So.. now I have a place to go seven days a week that is every bit as good as my normal Chiro. I have only gone to the weekend chiro but my wife and one of my employees have seen Dr. Brian and they love him. So if you need a good Chiro... go see these guys any day of the week. Try em you'll love em!|1
Ohhh this is the best place ever! Every thing I have ordered has been delish!|1
"Lived in house for 9 years and just thought was time to replace the carpeting, had used some of those ""$99 room"" services over the years for routine cleaning, met Ray Odom, Owner of Hydro-Pro, and gave them a crack at cleaning the carpets before I replaced them. I was Amazed at results, by the time they were done the carpets looked brand new, took their time and did incredibally throrugh job.  Great service at reasonable price-well worth it. My carpet cleaner from now on."|1
I was very impressed with the service and food. St Francis provided a delicious meal and beautiful ambiance that was just right for a group of clients after work.|1
Still solid, still delicious. I love this place!|1
Mesa Amphitheatre is easily my favorite concert venue in the Phoenix area.  You can see and hear from anywhere in the place, and the grassy risers were such a good idea.  The sound was excellent for the two shows I've been to there.  Really just an overall nice, peaceful place to see a show and enjoy the Arizona weather.  Parking isn't too bad and neither are the lines to get in where they check your bags.  To top it all of, getting out of there was a breeze both times I was there.|1
Whenever I'm looking for a quick healthy lunch, and am tired of salads from the grocery store, I swing by Zoe's Kitchen on Camelback. For a long time I used to get the spinach and chicken quesadillas, however last time I went in, I realized they didn't have them on the menu anymore. The manager that was on duty was super friendly and helpful, and explained it was now basically the spinach roll-ups (add chicken). I must say, they are even more delicious!  Is it your cheapest lunch option? Probably not. I'm a frugal person by nature, but it definitely beats eating Fast Food. So it's worth the extra buck or two to know you're not loading yourself up with tons of grease and carbs. I've introduced a lot of my coworkers to Zoe's and they all love it too. Now if only they can open up in Gilbert or Chandler near where I live!|1
Special. Not on menu. Chicken strawberry raspberry blackberry blueberry goat cheese salad with raspberry vinagerette. This was THE best salad I've ever had, and probably top 5 best meals in my life.|1
I'm a girl who knows her way around a donut. The boyfriend and I would usually venture out to Chandler to get our Bosa Donut fix so I was super excited to discover they had opened a location closer to home. I was also super scared for my waistband.  Bosa is hands down the best donut shop in the Valley. Not that there is a ton of competition but still. They're really good. They offer a wide variety from your classic cake to puffy glazed, filled to fritters. My favorite is the glazed twist. So chock full of sugary sweetness my teeth kinda hurt just thinking about it. Their donuts are always fresh and they keep a good stock available so you're not stuck with only the coconut donuts.  I brought in a bunch to work the other day and my co-workers gobbled them up. Who doesn't love being handed a frosted piece of donut heaven?  I'm sure I will become a regular of the Tempe Bosa in no time.|1
I love pita Jungle! Everytime I am in town, I make it a point to get here. The food is fresh and healthy(ish). There ice tea comes in a variety of wonderful flavors and is so delicious. I would recommend you eat here, especially if you like yummy food with a medditeranean flare.|1
Went here for the first time last week and had a great experience. The restaurant was very clean, the service was great. The best part? The food. I've been in AZ for 10 years now and I can say without a doubt that its some of the best food I've had in a restaurant (and this from a pregnant woman no less ;)  I had the fried chicken tenders, cheesy grits and fried okra. First, the food came out piping hot, I mean steaming and hot to the touch. The batter on the chicken was thick and crispy. The grits were cooked to perfection- dry enough to hold together a bit but still moist. And the okra was fantastic, too. It didn't hurt that my fresh lemonade came in a mason jar, either.   I will be back. a lot :)|1
Went here for our anniversary.  Pretty much what you would expect from an upper end steak house.  Yes, it's pricey.  Steaks were good and service was attentive.  A good place to celebrate.|1
My husband and I drove from LA to Scottsdale and almost to Scottsdale, one of our tires was going flat.  We went to Discount Tire on Shea and they checked it and found it was a cracked wheel (the tires are new).  They helped us get a new tire shipped from the east coast and put it on first thing the next morning.  They were nice, helpful, honest and affordable.  Absolutely great service!  I highly recommend them.|1
I have been eating at this Waffle house since I was a teenager and it has never failed to provide good food.  The employees are courteous and the service is fast.  The portions are good for the price and the small dinner feel is great to eat in.  I have gone here many times with my disabled brother and have never had any problems with the staff or employees.  I also like the fact that they are one of the few 24 hr restaurants available to eat at and this has come in handy many times.|1
Mostly I love the Rokerij just because I love saying the name.    But the food is also killer.  I had the most amazing chicken, and the sides, which usually I just take for granted as filler food, were sodelicious that they caught my attention in a big way.  I also tried my date's steak, and while it was fairly spendy, it sure seemed worth it.  The feel of the place is great too, with the dark stone walls and coziness without feeling too crowded.  We ventured downstairs to look at the bar, and had we been there early enough to snag a couch I wouldn't have wanted to leave.  It definitely feels like a splurge, or somewhere you'd take a business associate or date that you wanted to wow.  It's manages a high end feel, while remaining unmistakably local.  I can't say I'd suggest it just for any old night, but it will stay on top of my list for special occasions.|1
Great selection, TONS of flavor, always hot and fresh, nice staff, great prices. In my top 3 quick restaurants.|1
"I Love Lolo's Chicken and Waffles and you will too!   Recently my fiancé and I went to Lolo's. I had heard about Lolo's and Mrs. White's for years, but never took the time to go to the Phoenix locations. When this south Scottsdale location opened, I made it a point to go and try the food.   The food is excellent or in my best Brooklyn accent ""Forget about it"". But don't forget about it, the MAC-N-CHEESE is a most try. The chicken is FANTABULOUS, the COLLARD GREENS are on point and they serve Kool Aid. Yes I said Kool Aid. I must have had a gallon of GRAPE KOOL AID. Before this, the last time I had Kool Aid was 1968.   This place is very popular, so you may have to wait for a table, but it is well worth it. This place is so popular that Sports, Music, Acting and Reality celebrities can be seen here regularly. When we were there we saw the rapper Biz Markie. He did the song ""Just a Friend"" back in 1990.    The only down side - although the service was generally good, it gets so busy that at times the server may get distracted and may not come back to you as timely or often as you may like.   BOTTOM LINE, I LEFT FULL, HAPPY AND WITH A KOOL AID SMILE. TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT"|1
Stayed here for the RocknRoll marathon like 80% of the guests and absolutely enjoyed my stay.  the hallways to the rooms were the only slightly blah decor, all other things such as the bedrooms, bathroom, lobby, restaurant and pools were great!  Amenities included: 1. pet fish (that someone else fed) 2. complimentary granola for the race day 3. smores for our firepit (next to the pool) 4. nice wait-staff that was pleasant and chatted us up 5. super fast towel replenishment service (4 girls use up a lot of towels) 6. great cabanas -we never had a problem snagging one or two of them 7. happy hour, decent food, delicious alcohol... 8. cool lobby area with lots of places to looooounge at 9. dog friendly 10. heated pools  love it!  I will stay here again for sure..|1
Finally a raw food cafe that isn't in Tempe.  Love their drinks and raw food menu.  Just wish their prices would come down bit.      This is the type of place I could eat at everyday.  I know it is good because the afternoon lull doesn't happen to me when I eat here.      I do NOT go daily, due to pricing, but I would like too, because I would simply live longer eating here.  Your body buzzes with clean energy (non-caffeine) after eating here.    If you are a person who wants to be nice to your body.  Splurge and give your body what it craves....Enzymes.      Who knew raw food was the answer to avoiding afternoon coffee.......?|1
Friendly group. Great specials....Try THE BASIC breakfast. It's more than enough.|1
We just tried this out this afternoon following lunch at Pita Jungle next door.   It's a self-service yogurt shop where you pay by the ounce once you've finished your creation.    The offerings included the standard vanilla and chocolate, but also less traditional offerings like Irish Mint and Red Velvet were also available.  They offer a taste of any of the products, and you can mix multiple types of yogurts in your container.  They also offer a variety of standard yogurt shop toppings for your creation.  I had a combination of the Irish Mint and Latte yogurts, with a couple of toppings.  The yogurt itself was smooth, creamy and well flavored.  We'll likely be dropping by here in the future.|1
Put it this way: Every guest I have in Phoenix, I force to get the Monte Cristo at Morning Glory. It is just that good.|1
I can't describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste! They literally MELT in your mouth- a few of my favorites are the Cajun Chicken, Dill Salmon, and the Stilton & Steak---Bon Appetit everyone! And don't forget about the all day everyday-$3 car bombs(you can't beat that price) their happy hour is amazing, too!|1
The BEST brewery I've ever been to. Amazing beer and awesome food (I didn't think that combo was actually possible)! I daydream about this place all the time since I spent so much time here while going to school at ASU. Whenever I go back to Phoenix, this is always a must on my list!|1
love the food and the services ,but you neesd to weight at 350ib to eat the burgers for free, the burgers are big and jucey|1
Matt's was absolutely fantastic. Got there at 2pm on a Sunday, which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close), as we walked right in, sat right down, and had food in 5 minutes or less. Brilliant.  I had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll.   By default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.  The girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.  I can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back. Probably near 2 o'clock again, to avoid the wait!|1
first time my friend and I went there... it was delicious!  The food, garlic knots our favorite and of course the wine!  We will be going back ALOT!|1
"A chain, yes. But par for the course, no.   First of all, they have an extensive wine list, which includes a rare type of sparkling wine, called Brachetto. In this area, DUI's are more common than a cold, and it's a light and tasty wine, with a low alcohol content. So it's option is great for me. It also goes great with everything they serve, because of it's unique flavor profile.  Lizzie was our waitress, and offered options and suggestions, which actually saved us quite a bit of money on the whole. Not that, by any stretch of the imagination, is this a place to go when you are not intending a big splurge. This is a place to take it slow and spend slightly over a decent amount.   The food, however, is absolutely worth it. We tried the Cheddar fondue, which could have used a bit more mustard powder and worstershire sauce, but on the whole was delicious. It was well prepped, and Lizzie explained what she was adding and why the whole time. The veggie selection is a bit mundane, and that's really my only complaint. We ate the ""big night out"" prix fix menu and chose the ""Fusion"" option which had lobster tail, shrimp, brats, ravioli, new york strip, sirloin steak, and a marinated chicken. We cooked it in the Boullion method which is just a flavored broth. Because it's not oil, you do need to add 30 sec to a min to the suggested cook times, but it was a lot lighter than using the oil and we didn't come home smelling like oil. The california salad was incredible. It had mixed greens, sliced roma tomatoes, chopped pecans, and blue cheese crumbles with a rasberry black walnut dressing. It's been a long time since I was able to truly enjoy a salad, and this was amazing. The chocolate we chose was the Smore. It was milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with grahm cracker bits added after the fire goes out. It's served with 2 types of coated marshmallows, pound cake, a slice of cheese cake, and a bowl of sliced strawberries and bananas. Just enough to fill us up, but we didn't overstuff ourselves. Our dinner was leisurely paced and took us about 2 to 2 1/2 hrs to get through. This is pretty normal for fondue. You do have the option of sitting at the bar and having just a cheese or chocolate, if you are on a time constraint though.  It's located in a great little shopping and dining area that wasn't too crowed last night, but I think that was more due to the weather, than the actual popularity of the place."|1
Came here with a large group a while back.  We were there to eat and have a beer before a concert there. It was a weekday so we made it to happy hour. Happy Hour pricing was fair. The food was pretty good. The very best thing there is the beer!  They had like everything on tap! MMMM!|1
A hipster shindig- for day and night- make your meal with THE Burger au Poivre, Cobb Salad and best made cocktails around... One of the best places for brunch!|1
Let's see...what is there NOT to like about Surprise Stadium? Well, $9.50 tall cans of PBR is about all I could come up with and that's not a surprise (pun intended) considering you're attending a sporting event...even spring training.   But as someone who does not living in Arizona, and as someone who doesn't go to MLB baseball games in Southern California due to the fact it costs so damn much, people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here. Look, you're lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost MLB baseball right in your back yard. If I could, I'd live down here during March just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the Phoenix metro area each year.   I attended my first spring training game on March 12th, 2012 at Surprise Stadium as the Royals took on the San Francisco Giants (my favorite team). Our seats (Sec. 112, Row J, Seats 13-14-15) were 25 bucks each (around 30 bucks including service fees). I mean, we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the Giants dugout (check out some of my pictures). The stadium (funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10,000 people) is big enough so you feel you're at an MLB game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players. The stadium is well maintained and kept super clean.   Arriving to the park, I was surprised (pun unintended) to see that parking was free, an oddity when going to an event like this. The stadium staff, as mentioned by other reviews, are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful. I didn't have to wait long at the concession stands, even if lines were a bit long. The outfield is lined with a lawn area, perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game (Tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees!!!).   I love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family. Oh, Giants won 2-1! Go Giants!!!|1
This is one of  best libraries I have ever been to.  I live very close by and it is very easy to stop by to pick something up or drop something off.  This is always a must visit before road trips to California to pick up books for the adults and kids as well as DVD 's for the road trip.  We visit this location at least once a week and the kids love it.|1
"Need fig preserves? They've got it. Fennel? It's beautifully packed on ice and extremely fresh in the produce department. Need boneless pork loin roast from the blade end? The butcher has your back. Duck fat? Just take a peek in the freezer section. Sometimes, it's the little things that normally go unnoticed that gets you five stars...  AJ's closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel. I came up empty handed on both items. I say ""simple"" items - but it's amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise. AJ's carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for!  Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted, it was during my adventures to the 4 stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer. How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I-10 freeway courtesy of my phone company, but can't find fennel within a 10 mile radius?  This my friends, is why I love AJ's. And as someone who watches America's Test Kitchen as though it were food porn, I can say that any other grocer doesn't stand a chance against Eddie Bashas' high end store.  You truly do get what you pay for. For all the employees at AJ's I say ""THANK YOU!!"" for the great service you provide and the products you offer."|1
Still 5 stars, but sadly Amber is closing up shop.  Don't feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business.  She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her.  Damn her!!!  I did pick up some jeans and 3 shirts, all at 60% off.  So hurry over and pick up some bargains!  And wish Amber good luck!|1
everything, everyone has posted about this company is true! great service, friendly people, good pricing! highly recommend!|1
The closest thing I have to a neighborhood pub.  Not bad.  They sell loads of Belgian and Canadian beer.  That is all that you need to know.|1
"The Farm at South Mountain is a splendid little slice of the country- right here in the middle of the desert!  The plentiful green grass spotted with picnic tables makes me want to plan a family reunion. There are gardens and walkways to explore. From first glance, The Farm is a quaint, family-run farmhouse.  Visit Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast and you won't be disappointed. I've personally enjoyed the Morning Glory Benedict on several occasions, while my brother is a big fan of the Farm Monte Cristo. Both dishes are made with as many local ingredients as possible... mmm... local-icious.   The Farm Monte Cristo is about as close as any breakfast food gets to ""groin-grabbingly delicious."" (a la Homer Simpson) It's slow baked ham, over easy eggs, and melted cheese between two generous pieces of French Toast. Served with warm maple syrup, this is it, folks. The grand-daddy of breakfast foods.   The service here is generally solid. Our servers tend to be interesting, friendly, and adorable- all good qualities to have when you're serving breakfast to someone who isn't happy about being up early.  I'll return... and return... and return. I'm hooked.  I only wish Morning Glory wasn't closed for the summer! Killing me."|1
Four Peaks serves up some great beers and great eats.  This is no secret so no matter which day out of the year or which hour and minute out of the day you go you will see a full patio, and a populated bar.  Plan accordingly.  Try their Italian beer bread, the Carne Adovada, or the Southwest burger and wash it down with a pint of Hop Knot or Kilt Lifter.  You will be happy you did.  All of Four Peaks' menu items are appropriately priced and you will always leave satisfied.|1
So many flavors and the ice is melt in your mouth soft. Add cream to make it a little better than a normal icey treat! Lots of sugar free flavors too! Mmm!|1
I used to work here back when it was a Harkins.  It's way better now.  Comfortable, friendly, laid-back.  Kind of decorated in a golden age of hollywood style.  I dig it.|1
Whenever I get my car cleaned, this is the place that I'll always go to.  They're nice, efficient, and they do a great job.  My car is still shining a week later!  The wait is very minimal.  The staff works together fantastically, and you can watch them clean your car so you don't have to worry about anything getting stolen.  Yeah it's a little small, and a bit shabby, but like the first reviewer said, you don't go there for the waiting experience!  Definitely worth the money!|1
Not that you can compare Firebird to anywhere else in Az but I have been to Joliet Raceway in Chicago (and even though that's newer) I like the arrangement of Firebird and the availability of the different tracks available to race on.  First off...  NHRA... come on... hands down one of THE coolest events in Az ever, next to NASCAR and well pro any sports but the 8000hp cars come only once a year.  The pits are setup nice so every ticket gets into the pits to check out the teams and cars, beer and food are expensive but what else is new.  They also have drag racing events, any type of racing event, drift, road, moto races, dirt bikes, monster trucks, top fuel drag boats on the lake... I'm sure I'm missing a lot but nowhere else has this in Az.  Parking is always good to go... driving out of there just takes a while as you've got one main road that you get on to funnel onto the I-10 but not much they can do about that.  Great place... keep bringing in the NHRA and letting us use the road tracks for our motorcycles and I'll be happy.|1
"We were in town on Business and Pleasure and had a chance to visit Aiello's with our Children, 10 and 7.  What a TREMENDOUS experience it was overall and then to top it all off, a chance to win ""dinner on the house"" via drawing a number out of a bucket, was simply superb.  We didn't win but will definitely come back next time we are in town as the food, staff, and overall dining experience was unbeatable!"|1
One word can describe the food here:  perfection.  All the meals I've had here has been absolutely delicious served by the most charming waitstaff.  Someone recently told me their Chilean Sea Bass was the best he's ever had and I believe him . . . I can't wait to taste that dish!|1
"Off the chainco's! lol  Today my friends and I pondered what to eat.. a good sandwich was was we decided on but where? Looked right here on yelp and it came up.. most the reviews were good so we went for it. WOW.  I like to ask for a knock my socks off never been here suggestion and he offered up the cheese steak, with peppers and mushroom. I went for it but was on the fence for my pasta side dish.. he handed me a sample of the tortalini and I was in heaven.  Service was polite, the place was busy but not crowded, it was clean, and very appealing to look around while waiting for our order.  Took about 10 minutes to arrive, not bad.  I thought the price was fair  and i could have went with just a half sandwich as it was very filling.   While eating my buddy joked the place was off the chain.. and should rename itself to ""off the chainco's"" lol  Highly recommended and cant wait to take others here.   -Shawn"|1
i always forget about this place when we do a party. they carry costumes and party gear year round...even halloween stuff.   stopped in today to look for a flintstones costume but they had no Fred's and the wilma they had for 50 bucks, we bought on-line for 30 bucks. i had an online coupon for 15 bucks so i only bought house decor for halloween. but if you need any kind of prop for a costume/theme party, bike pub ride, or just feel like dressing up, this place is perfect!|1
"I know Kerrie through my networking and we benefit from her presence.  I have not needed her service's and most of us don't plan on needing an attorney. But I am always reminded by a tagline that Kerrie often mentions.   ""People in crisis need company, Droban & Company"".   How very true. When that time comes, and in these troubled days, it WILL. You will need good company. I would look for Kerrie to help and so should you."|1
I am very particular about where I go for sushi.  I can name ten places I will not go to, and have struggled to find a place to frequent; until now.  I have only been here about 5 times, but every time was a great experience.  Great food, staff, prices,and atmosphere.|1
Best pizza in AZ, hands down.|1
It's a restaurant in a gas station, but it merits five stars b/c it has glass bottles of soda, just like you find in Mexico.  Good food too.  It's actually not nearly as bad inside as you'd think, it's pretty well set apart from the gas station sales, so I wouldn't mind eating there.  They have a few tables set up inside.  I usually get takeout though (they also deliver).    MANZANA LIFT ROCKS!!!  I'm also going to be drinking the Sprite in the bottle, (cane sugar ftw) and the horchata.  I don't care about Chipotle opening near work anymore, I've found a new Mexican fix for lunch.  What a happy day.|1
I was there last week with my sisters and while we ordered our steaks cooked medium, all of them came out well done. Kind of disappointed, but oh well.  So last night my fiance and I had a buy-one-get-one-free coupon, so we headed over. When I ordered my steak cooked medium, I asked her to make a point of it when she put the order in because of the issue last week.  When our food came out, she asked me to cut into my steak and make sure it was cooked the way I wanted. I did and, while it was a bit more medium-well than medium, I was hungry and it looked good, so I gave it the go ahead and we started our meal. It really was a good steak.  When our waitress came out again, she double checked that my steak was cooked correctly. I assured her it was fine. A few minutes later a manager came out and apologized for my steak being over done and offered to replace it. I assured him it was maybe a little overdone, but it was good and I was happy with my meal. They were being very nice and showing some great customer service, though a little overzealous. :)  When the bill came, they had made my steak the free one for the coupon, even though mine was the more expensive of the two meals we ordered.  Great customer service, and very good food.|1
This is my favorite spot, waterfalls everywhere, beautiful flowers, fun slide, and great food!|1
I seriously can't get enough of this spicy goodness! All I ever wanna go is SIAM and nowhere else. I've been to so many Thai restaurants in AZ the past month and NOTHING compares to Siam! BEEF MA SA MAN curry is so addictingly amazing and the pad thai is always cooked to perfection. I'm actually craving it as I type this.|1
Sanctuary you've been replaced.  Willow Stream Spa is my new fav spa spot.  Loved. Loved. the service. Robe got slightly damp from use, helpful attendant appears and gives me a new one.  Loved the waterfall treatment.  Loved private rooftop pool.  Loved the attendant walking around giving us sun bathers bottles of cold water.  Loved the fitness classes, the facility. All this for $50 during AZ Spa Week.   The facility and service is so f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s here that I would come here anytime and think every penny I spent was worth it!|1
"This place was great. When one of my coworkers sent an email to our group who was visiting Phoenix saying he had gotten us a reservation at ""The BEST pizza in the country"" i Was skeptical. Best pizza in Phoenix? Well, I wasn't disappointed!   We had a group of 8., and we ordered almost one of everything on the menu: Apps: Antipasto - Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of Cheese Spiedini - Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm  Pizza: MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil  MARINARA - Tomato Sauce, Oregano, Garlic (No Cheese)  ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios  SONNY BOY - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives  BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula  WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage   Of all of them, the Biancoverde was my absolute favorite! I don't eat pork, so I couldn't sample them all, but I'd happily order this one again. In fact, my team is returning next week for another team dinner for the coming Phoenix trip, and I will for sure be ordering this.  Their house draft beer is also quite tasty!  Tip - if you are a party of 6-10, get a reservation! They don't take reservations for smaller groups and I've heard the wait time can be a few hours at the busiest times! But worth it!"|1
"Tucked on the western edge of the Foothill Acres neighborhood in North Phoenix or what I would call ""The Slope"", Try Me Bicycle Shop has been in business for nearly 40 years and has been collecting the odd part for every type of bike over that time.   The showroom is filled with cruisers and comfort bikes, new and used. No high end bikes here but they do have an inventory of old and hard-to-find parts, good service and free air that makes this place."|1
I'm sorry to say that they closed their doors for good just a few weeks ago!|1
I can't say enough good things about this place.  I literally have never had a plate here I didn't like, they also have a interesting and ever changing list of specials (I usually order off the specials menu).  This is definitely one of those places I could eat at every day.  All that and I don't even drink beer, my friends really like the beer here though.|1
While Calabria Italian Kitchen & Deli is at this location the Grocery portion has been CLOSED.|1
Full disclosure: one way or another, I have only been to Roaring Fork for the Happy Hour, but the happy hour is darn good. You can, and you should, get that kettle of green chili pork or the big-ass burger, or better yet, share the two with someone nice. The huckleberry margarita is so good, I've had three in one sitting (no, I wasn't driving!). I fully intend to get over there for dinner soon, because I keep seeing the sugar cured duck on the menu and just thinking about it right now my mouth is watering. It gets pretty busy during the happy hour, though, so be prepared to wait a little if your party is large.|1
Kindred Spirits has closed their doors. It is a sad thing that we on the west side of Phoenix cannot support such a friendly and community oriented business, AND one that gave you the option to drop by for a quick coffee or for a more complete dining experience. The live music on the weekends was also something a bit rare for our side of town, and will be missed. Richard and Debra did a marvelous job updating the space, and making it a warm and welcoming place. I am sorry that Youngtown has lost this business.|1
Awesome.  So much better than parking on site.  Safe and good prices keep me coming back.  Flying during a busy time, go to their website to make a reservation...that's right a reservation! Also print out a coupon for a couple bux off per day.|1
We loved this place.|1
my first time here at blue 32 was great. i came for happy hour I had the chicken wings and a chambord margarita both are fantastic! service was friendly and fast.|1
"This past weekend I went to The Vig Uptown twice because it was that  good. This is a perfect place to hangout with friends and get a bite to eat with a really great drink menu. What I love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill. The cherry on top is the games they have to offer, Bocce and Bags!  Drinks 1. Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order, made with Vodka/Ginger beer and fresh lime juice.  2. If you bring in your own ""pimp cup"" any size, They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup.  Food 1. VigAzz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing. 2. Thai spicy Vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that i've ever had so I highly recommend getting them."|1
Great place! I've been coming here for quite some time now and every time I received excellent customer service. The servers are always friendly and attentive.  I LOVE the sushi there. They have a lot of fun, new rolls that are unique to Bamboo Grille. The spicy sauce they put on the rolls gives them a great kick too.  Recently I've noticed that the place has looked a little unfinished with random stuff here and there. Baffled, I asked a server and was informed that they are in the process of remodeling. Needless to say I'm excited for the newly designed Bamboo Grille!|1
Alright, went back last night, felt bad because we were the late nighters, and everything was perfect.  The pizza, the salads and the wine were all so well done.  And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone.  OMG amazing.  I'm currently craving it the day after.  Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love...|1
Love this place.  Great staff!  Friendly, fun and knowledgable.  The food is always good.|1
"Einsteins in general has mediocre bagels at best, and their ""schmears"" appear to be highly processed.  I've generally given up on Einsteins all together because because their food has really taken a nose dive, as has the service.  I stopped by this location recently because I was driving by and in a hurry, and wanted a bagel (they're supposed be a bagel store after all!).  First, no salt bagels.  Aren't salt bagels one of the standards?  Second, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese (cream cheese being a $1.50 option) to go and that was my real mistake.  Whoever made the bagel didn't even manage to slice all the way through the bagel and put an amount of cream cheese approximately equivalent to a pat of butter on one-half of the bagel.  The other half was basically dry.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed when I got to work and opened up my bagel.  Stick to any of the local bagel joints like Chompies or Kashmans - they have much better bagels, and they will dump a brick of cream cheese on them for you."|0
I wish I could rate this place higher but my blow out is terrible. I asked for a blowdry with lots of volume and curl. It seemed that the cross between the mai-tai and cosmo would be perfect. My hair is flatter than what I walked in with. My hair is curly naturally so has decent volume, but for some reason its flat! Also the stylist pulled my hair alot while blow dryng and apologized for hurting me which I appreciated, but have never experienced with a blowdry before. I don't think I'll be coming back, sad since I love the concept and the salon is lovely.  Update: They offered me a make up blow out. I decided to try the place out again, thinking it was a fluke that my blowdry was so awful. Mistake! Not only was my second blowdry here mediocre, I ended up paying for the service. I wrote to their manager who had offered the complimentary blowdry, but no response.|0
Boy is the name a temptation.Seriously :)  I'll try to be fair though but I'm writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing. So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.    Texas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.  Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn't. :(   Entrees.  Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:)   Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned.   Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.  Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible:   Steak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.  ( that's for this occasion only , past two times it's been great fun for the kid,)  1.5 rounded to 1 for the carrots.|0
"Wow! I can't believe this place gets so many good reviews.  I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you don't even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; ""white meat chicken"" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service."|0
"This is going to be brutal.  Hide the children.  If you've been to Chipotle, you'll feel right at home at Qdoba. That is, until you start eating. Complete and utter ripoff of the concept, except for the part that matters - the execution.  Where Chipotle succeeds, Qdoba fails miserably.  The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier.  The burritos are just plain bad..  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat - basically the opposite of what you'll get at the ""other"" place.  On top of that, the rice and beans were the suck.  And if you know Brak, you know that he LOVES his beans.  But not these.  About all they're good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crap.  If you want to know the root cause of this debacle, check out who the parent company is - it's Jack In The Crack®.  Pretty much explains it all.  Avoid at all costs.  Receives Brak's dreaded zero-star review, rounded up to 1 because Yelp doesn't allow a zero."|0
Decided to give Tempe Marketplace another try after reading recent reviews (hoping that they had improved). I had to ask myself if we were visiting the same place. The traffic and parking situation are still horrible and the loudspeakers in the parking lot are unacceptable. The JC Pennys and Targets are crippled versions of their regular stores at other malls. The stores here all open too late (11am, REALLY???) to be useful in our uber hot summers (except for a Targets that opens at 8am).  Even though I am a Tempe resident, I will continue to choose the Riverview shopping area on Dobson over this mish-mashed monstrosity.|0
3 months, 22 emails, 10 plus calls and (I think) we have the final refund from Budget!  Stay clear of Budget Rental they DO NOT care about customers or resolving their monumental mistakes!|0
"We decided to hit up the ""Wine Down Wednesday"" that was happenin' at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.  Here's what went wrong:  The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held.  We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.  20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine.  It's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago...  By now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much, but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own ""Wine Down Wednesday"" at home.  I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However, any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of ""if I could give them less than 1 star I would"" comes in...  Oh yeah, and I slapped down a ""You've been Yelped"" card as I left.  Take that Tastings!!"|0
I want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there aren't many other options around here, but this is probably the worst restaurant/bar I've ever had the misfortune of going to.   My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.    I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.  On other trips here my wife and I have had the food.  It's not any better than the service sadly.  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.  Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.  Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.  Avoid at all cost.  I wouldn't eat here again, but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.  Looking at other reviews on here, I see I'm not alone in my feelings about the service.  Get rid of these people already... just sad!!|0
"One hour. That is how long we waited after ordering before we decided we would rather eat anywhere that wasn't here. A crushing, impressively underwhelming experience in lack of service.  We arrived, found we had free valet parking? With a teensy parking lot, this works, thank you. A good selection of indoor and outdoor seating? Also a plus. Setting expectations and/or taking care of waiting customers? FAIL.  On a beautiful AZ autumn morning we came here (tho we entered Rockerij). We asked to be re-seated outside because inside of Rockerij is dark as a tomb and had loud, conversation intruding, music. We were reseated by the fireplace, and a waiter came over shortly to take our order. Bam. So far so good...or so we thought. 30 Mins after placing our order, I ask another waiter to check on the status of our food and he cleverly asks about what we ordered (exactly)...so we think it is being taken care of. 40 MINS after placing our order, I have still only had my coffee refilled once...and had to flag down another waiter to inquire about the status of our food again, because our actual waiter is nowhere to be found and the previous ""drive-by"" waiter never returned. A few mins beyond that, this guy actually comes back and indicates that our order is nearly ready and should only be a few minutes longer. Shortly thereafter OUR waiter stops by with comments of:   ""I don't know why it's taking so long..."" and ""I put the ticket in right after I took your order...""  So...as a waiter...maybe it might be part of your job to check on the status of an order say...15mins after bringing it by the kitchen? Perchance? What do you think?  FIFTEEN (15 == few?) minutes later, we still had no food and I'd had quite enough. Out the door we went.  On a comical note: As we were outside (another 5 minute wait because the valet had our car either parked in Egypt somewhere or tandem?) our waiter came out to find us to let us know that our food was ready if we'd like to come back inside?  Oh R E A L L Y? The Clue-Delivery Train will be visiting you shortly. Facial cues you may want to look for in the future are: 1) the furrowed eyebrows 2) fuck-you facial expression and 3) curling fists  It seems that we are not alone in this. Courtney W.'s review (10/14/12) is representative of what we experienced.  I am dumbfounded how they have any good reviews. There must be a serious drought of sit down restaurants in this part of town, because this crap would never fly where I live. I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.  P.S. They own 3 restaurants apparently: Richardson's, Rokerij, and Dick's Hideaway...all right in the same area (Rokerij and Richardson's being attached).   P.P.S. They all serve the same menu. It is NOT amazing. I have previously been to Dick's. Yes, it is good. No my socks did not come flying off.  P.P.P.S. ProTip: Drive down to Central Phoenix and go to Durant's, Portland's, Switch, or Fez. All of these places have exemplary service and food to match."|0
I am a huge fan of Chipotle but I will never come back to this location. The staff looks miserable and are SLOW. The cashier decided she would rather clean tables then ring people up so we waited for her to come back. Most of the tables were already clean so she could of waited to clean. The rice was crunchy like it wasn't cooked all the way and the steak was really chewy. Never again!|0
Huge line for incompetent employees who don't even know how to wash cars.|0
Shocked this place has 4 stars. First off you can always tell if a Mexican food place is good based on the beans and the salsa. Well guess what both suck! Eat at el molino's and you will never come here again!|0
If I could give zero stars, I would. Just about the worst experience for my friend and I. We came in for a quick and easy dinner.  After being ignored at the door way repeatedly, we sat ourselves.  First, we had a girl server who said shed be back with menus, but right in front of us at the bar we see her flirting instead of coming back. Our server switched to another guy who was just as bad at serving. I have no idea how this place ever received more than one star based on the staff alone. They're lazy, slow, and completely ruin the entire experience of dining there.  The happy hour prices are great, but there are other RA's so do yourself a favor and go to a different location.|0
This is the closest to a New York hipster style coffee shop I've seen in Arizona.  They serve beer too.  Problem is that the espresso was unbelievably bitter.  Cookie happy hour is pretty cool though.|0
One star is far more than they deserve.  The owner of the property spent an excessive amount of time barking out reminders of hotel policy, was rude to guests and his staff.  The stay here felt more like being in prison with the warden constantly in your face.  People in the group that stayed were locked out of the room by management, forced to pay made up fines.  The owner ruined the entire experience.  If this is how customers are treated, this place won't be around long.|0
I parked in the Parking Garage, got my parking ticket validated, and still owed money for parking.  The parking validation was worth $3.00.  The charge for parking was $5.00 with $2.00 credit for the validation (not the $3.00 I was promised).  I paid the remaining $3.00 charge, but then, the machine wouldn't give me a receipt.  I am never going back to this location.  It is off my radar from now on.|0
My husband and I were really, really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.  We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34,000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.  The moon roof wouldn't open or close, but you could hear the motor working.  After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.    We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way!  I find it VERY hard to believe that Coulter didn't know this was the problem.  We are now searching for a new SUV, and will not be choosing Infiniti.  How disappointing.|0
We had looked to buy a unit here & looked at several units, then decided to rent for a while first.  We've been here almost a year & loved it at first, but have had horrible noise problems for about 8 months & management won't do a thing about it.   The walls here are paper-thin & we our neighbor plays her music loudly at 3am almost every night.  It's so loud that we had to move our bed to the other side of the room and run a humidifier all night just to try to block the noise, but that doesn't work.  We've called security several times, but it never seems to help.  The ceilings are also very thin & you can easiy hear any walking above you.   Aesthetically this place looks great.  The gym is great too, but the construction is horrible.|0
"I am furious.  In the last 12 months, I have had at least scheduling issues, from them calling me at 8AM on a Saturday morning (my 1 day off) to cancel my 11am appointment to last Saturday, when I went in only to be told someone had messed up, and actually booked me for the NEXT week, and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am, they couldn't get me in until maybe that evening, and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissue/medical massage. I was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then, but Ashley the clinic manager promised me that they'd give me my next week appointment free of charge, and that she'd personally be certain there were no more issues.  As I literally couldn't turn my head to the left due to pain, I took her up on that. BIG MISTAKE.  Yesterday (the Friday before my ""correctly"" scheduled massage, I went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment, to try and avoid last week's debacle. According to the woman who answered the phone, it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off, but she went to talk with her manager, and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok, and that she'd call with any issues. Then yesterday evening, I got ANOTHER confirmation call from Massage Envy, confirming and reminding me of my 11:30am appt on Saturday with my preferred therapist. GIven that I've had 3 migraines this week (versus my 0 or 1 when I get a massage the weekend prior), I really absolutely needed to get in, so I felt more confident.  Well, I was just woken up at 8am...again. On my day off...again. To explain to me that, big shock, they messed up my scheduling again, and that apparently, my therapist was off today. Despite Ashley's promise of it not happening again. Despite me being pro-active and calling to confirm. I am sitting here in pain, so furious at this repeated treatment that I can't even go back to bed...and the best part? They don't even have a manager on duty I can complain to.  My treatment at the hands of the booking/front desk staff has been any thing BUT relaxing. I continue to walk out of there frustrated, angry, and occasionally in tears. I know they say Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me, but I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty screwed for today and the next week, but luckily, an Elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area. At this point, it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy. As much as I love Talisha and Aisha as massage therapists, getting a massage should feel good, and not like you're just a number to them, not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend IN the appointment."|0
This address is for the one next to Panda Express, not the one in Walmart.  This place sucks and it doesnt even come close to any other McDonalds. How in the world can you have so many employees working and have a line of people waiting for their food? It's like there is retarded people working there and they all have special needs. This one guys was just waiting for a happy meal and had been waiting for 10 minutes before I even got there. It them about 15 minutes for them to give me my food. One mexican kid that was working was to busy flirting with this girl in front of everyone, while her father was asking why the food was taking so long to make.   The dining area was dirty after I got my food and sat down. They should fire the manager and everyone that works there. They take no pride in working there and its sad to see this. It shouldnt matter what they are being paid to be there, its still a job and they ARE being paid to be there.   I will NOT be returning to this place.......|0
If you are over 24 you are too old to be here.    First, this place has beer.  Don't order mixed drinks, don't order wine, both are gross unless your sole purpose is to get trashed, which is the mission of every underage and young, young 20-something at this bar.  This is the place you'd go to with your fake ID because when you're 19 this is what you think a bar should be.  Expect people over drinking and throwing up very early on in the evening in the bathroom.|0
This place has the oiliest food I've ever eaten in my life.  I had carry out one evening (two dishes) and the entrees were soaked in oil.  I had to rinse with water my eggplant dish three times just to eat it without feeling sick to my stomach.  I wish I could've washed the other dish too (but it wasn't one that could be washed--it was a wide-rice noodle dish).  Can definitely taste the MSG in these dishes too.  Really not sure what the fuss is about.|0
Went there for a quick bite before the theater.   Had the buffalo sloppy joes, and they were disgusting--dry buns, thin sliced pickle.  Then had the duck spring rolls--also bad.   Then in an effort to eat something we could tolerate, ordered the lettuce cups with shrimp, and they were just adquate.   Very disappointing!|0
I went today to meet my daughter for lunch.  We are both big sushi enthusiasts.  The interior and atmosphere was beautiful.  Well appointed. The service was excellent.  We ordered edamame, was good...nothing to rave about.  Not much you can do to mess that up.  Drinks were well poured but exspensive for what you got.  Ordered five different sushi rolls. All five were bland, not much flavor and stale.  The fish was not fresh. Paid $12 for a soft shell crap roll and it tasted days old.  Will not go back. Did here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three.  My daughter says to give it another try.  We'll see... I'll let you know if I do.|0
This place is closed.  Good riddance.|0
"Don't know where I should start. Grand opening was on September 17th, 2010. We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off.  When I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular ""Chinese"" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.  Upon checking in with the hostess, they don't even issue numbers, they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all.  Once we finally got a seat, things got worse.  Our ""Har Gow""/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.  The trademark ""beef internal organs"" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon.   The BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.  I understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too.   I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell."|0
Sorry Banana Leaf... I'm usually not picky at all but the Thai Curry Tofu and Vegetable dish I picked up last night was awful.  Really... it was almost not edible.  The packaging was not great, so it kind of spilled a bit in the bag - not a good start.  Perhaps the curry is the 'yellow curry' that Jenny R refers to in her review - maybe the chef should taste it before serving it - it was nasty!  Seriously, I've had better Asian food from the food court at the mall before!  I will say, you did listen to my request to add eggplant to the dish - thank you... but if someone requests eggplant, perhaps you should make sure it's cooked fully next time.  I had a bite that was barely cooked - it was crunchy.    So, needless to say - I don't think I'll be giving you another shot.  First impressions sometimes last a lifetime.  Sorry Banana Leaf!|0
"The service here was awful, we waited patiently for over 15 minutes for our server to come by our table. Finally a hostess came by and noticed nobody was helping us and got us drinks. Another 15 minutes roll by and finally our server decides to make an appearance saying ""have you guys decided yet on what you want?"", uhh yeah! Overall, service was poor and food was just okay. Won't be going back."|0
I wish I could give this location a big fat ZERO.  But you can't.  But I can let everyone know how horrible it is.  For starters, their automatic doors do not even work.  I just find that appalling.  How can your doors not work on your store?  How are people supposed to get in there to shop.  The manager of this location is nothing more than a jerk.  I asked for help and all I received was attitude.  For a struggling supermarket that filed for bankruptcy, I would think service would be one thing you could promote at no cost.  But, not here.  I don't think it will be long before this location closes.  RIP!|0
"Received two more messages from ""Iolanda"" this morning.  Thought some of you might get a kick out of reading them.  I'm definitely never going back to 98 South.

My significant other had a $25 off coupon from Restaurant.com LOL. That could sum up the whole trip. I haven't been to many restaurants that participate with restaurant.com that are decent at all. I mean, I wasn't expecting much coming into this place, I shouldn't have expected anything here.  I was in the mood for some red meat, and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes. So, I didn't mind checking this place out since I do like a little bit of sushi on the side. The boolgogee, plain, simply plain. There was a salad with the boolgogee, but it too was plain. There wasn't nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of $8, because the salad and rice probably didn't cost more than $0.50 to make.  Oh, the sushi? All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy. By spicy, I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming. I tried a few bites of the 3-4 different rolls we got. After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite. We paid $18 for the food even after the coupon, and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper, higher quality sushi at Teharu.  This place is a rip-off for sushi in my opinion. Its not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag. The sad part is that the interior is very well done, if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting.|0
Last night on my way home from work I figured I would pick up some dinner for me and my wife who is taking care of our newborn all day and has little time to cook for us. I ordered chicken limone the menu says serves two to three and we don't eat a lot so I figured it would fill us up. The price was 18.99 but I figured in a family style Italian place and we should have plenty of food.   I was handed my bag and I was sure it was the wrong order because it was so light so I checked it in the car and was shocked.   I see three small pieces of chicken in a big container with a small piece of bread and that's it!   So I figured they just forgot the pasta and went back in and asked the hostess and she said yes it comes with it then said no after thinking about it.   So how can they justify that price? It was so small there was no way it would feed 2 people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave.  I worked in the service industry for years and this place is a joke!   FYI just because there's people with money who live near your restaurant doesn't mean you can tailor your food prices to their income level without delivering value.........if you sell crap in the worst neighborhood that same crap should be priced the same in a affluent neighborhood....same crap different place.  No value means lost customers ....|0
2nd time messing up our carry out order. Boneless wings have bones and no carrots or celery again!!  Hamburger with only tomato, cheese, and BBQ sauce had onions and lettuce, when we specifically said no lettuce or onion. Allergic to onions and don't like shredded lettuce. Thanks to Tiler for messing up our order again. Will not be back.|0
IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ!!! My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore). This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's.   We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself.   We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children.  To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family.|0
Should be called The Bad Egg. Bottom line, the hotel's free breakfast tasted better than this and we got better service there.   We arrived around 945am on a Sunday morning and had to wait around seven minutes to be seated. The staff was pleasant enough. We were seated, given menus with water and she took our order for coffee and the breakfast special (loaded potato skillet). We sat for 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again. She finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee. We finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor. Our food arrived about ten minutes after that. The skillet was supposed to contain sausage, bacon, onion, scrambled eggs, grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream. Mine had no bacon, two tiny chunks of sausage, no cheese, and the potatoes were so soggy, they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought. It was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite, even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce. The waitress never checked on us once during the meal. She came back by the time my husband was finished. I told her the meal was horrible (in a nice way). She offered me something else. By that point, I was not feeling like eating anything else, I felt kinda sick. My meal was comped and we did get an apology. The manager explained that everyone LOVES that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled. The cook obviously didn't try my potatoes. Blech. Even with the comp, the total was over $15 for one special and two coffees. Very hight priced for nasty food, poor service, and loud/uninspiring atmosphere.|0
The reviews were so good that my friend and I had to check it out. We were very disappointed this morning while trying to eat breakfast and swatting tons of flies!!! They were everywhere, on us, our food, the other customers - and this was inside.  The egg sandwiches were served on hamburger buns shaped like rolls - I could have went next door to get one just like it at McDonalds.  Not surprised people from Ahwatukee like this place, it looks nice but the food is so-so.|0
What was Dunkin Donuts thinking when they took out the selection of donuts and now only offer a choice of 10.  It used to be you couldn't decide which one to get, now you just have to settle for what they have.  This new and improved Dunkin Donuts is the worst.  I will return for coffee when I get the urge...but never for a donut!!   Oh and another thing...my Dunkin Donuts used to have Baskin Robbins inside...that is gone too...again WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!|0
Not lesbian/gay friendly at all. I should have read the previous review before going.|0
"Let me start by saying after my experience I surly wish they had half or quarter stars and I am not often found with a lack of words but this is going to take some effort to stomach.  Strolled into this establishment at about 1:30 am, now to their credit I fully understand the crowd on mill at these hours so I lower my levels of expectations..  Place is moderately busy as we walk in, I get to the counter, order some pepperoni pizza and a pretzel with 2 drink cups. Second drink cup is forgot after they ran out of the dispenser, after I remind him he gets a fresh stock of cups to replenish his dispenser but first takes his hand, fingers placed inside the cup and hand me one. Yuck.. Gf didn't catch it so I gave her the first cup and took the lingering finger taste cup as my own.   Fast forward a few minutes, guy is in there , his friends are loud and his face is cut wide open from who knows what incident.. He is arguing and finally his friends get him out the door. Now if I ran this place that guy and his yelling and problems would have been asked to stay, his hands Nd bloody shirt bumping and squeezing past people was discussing . But.. Let's let that go because it's busy and again this is MIll and it is 2 am..    Fast forward 10 minutes.. Tell the guy the ice machine is out, several minutes later.. They fill it.. Again it's busy, no big deal on that one, and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited.. ""I'm a wishful thinker""  Several more minutes go buy of people bustling past, smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by ""place was trashed"" I go back up and ask the guy for our order.. He said"", oh sorry forgot"" I was amused but it's just sliced pizza and a pretzel.. He tosses them in the oven, and a couple minutes later I get them. Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza, pretzel was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it.   Then the show starts.. there had been a few people in there, that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register, the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above..  Short list  -employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand, receiving money..then is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND.. Placing it in the oven, all with out gloves. This occurs over and over, then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps... Um.. Where did these guys come from, did they wash their hands?, eww.  So in the 45 minutes I am in here,no hand washing, no gloves..his hands on food, toppings, money, hands, face, along with all over surfaces possible. Freaking DISGUSTING.  But it gets better.. His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake..  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up, and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands.. This happens no less than 10 times..  Another one ask his to meet them in the bathroom... Um what? Yes.. That locked bathroom father 1 am that is closed off to customers.. Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom. could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drug's one can only speculate. His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person.  Where I will give this guy a couple points, is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed, well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyways..but was surprised at this point.   At this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didn't eat much. He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didn't finish.   He took it in stride, with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up. I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place. I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment.     In short, I'll be contacting the owner of this location.   I do realize this is a late night food offering, I do realize the clientele, but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call.   I will be back very soon, if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns. If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector.   -Thanks for reading this little novel."|0
This was the second time I placed an order over the phone that was delayed over an hour. I was told over the phone that it was going to be only 15-20 min for me to pick it up. I showed up 30 min later and my order was still delayed. I ended waiting for another half of hour to receive my order. The pick up service was the worse I have ever experienced.|0
I used to love Quiznos.... I would go out of my way to get a turkey bacon guacamole sandwich any day. At this point in my life I will no long be giving any money to this sorry excuse for a sandwich shop. The staff is rude and careless. I was given obviously bad guacamole... Which I didn't realize until i got home a took a bite of my sandwich to have the fowl taste in my mouth. It took 20 mins to get my sandwich, there was only one couple in front me. I'm done with this place. I should have went to paradise bakery across the street.|0
"As you walk in you are greeted by a sign that says Cash Only ATM inside alright times are tough I get it.  Then you see the special board which read ""Good Food Takes Time"" and there is a clock next to that.  Fine that's cool but the problem is that after waiting for our ""good food"" it came out and was awful.  My wife said she has tasted better pancakes out of the freezer section at the grocery store.  $30 later we boxed up the food only to throw it away.  The good news is that we went around the corner to the Breakfast Club and had an excellent meal."|0
"I suppose you could just put me in the ""box"" with ""Luis T"" on 3.20.10...because if i didnt know any better, his could have been my entry.. So i was here this week.  Let me start by saying i have been giving Los Dos Molinos my  business for almost 20 years now, and each year that goes by i find myself saying that i am going to cease my patronage.  I will save the stories from the recent years and why i've been feeling this way, and give you just the specifics from my most recent visit:  If you want to make the rule that there are ""No Split Checks"" then can you AT THE VERY LEAST get with the current times and make the bill somewhat decipherable?  We had a large party, and were quite promptly advised there were no split checks, yet at the end of the night we were left with a ribbon of calculator tape with ONLY prices, and no correlation with actual menu items...so we had to cross reference the menu to figure out what the heck all the itemizations correlated to.   And by the end of it, we pretty much gave up and just guessed at what each person should contribute because the receipt may have just as well been in morse code.  Ok, im getting ahead of myself..Its one thing if you have subpar service and the restaurant is slammed, understaffed, there is a MLB baseball game or NBA basketball game, or concert going on...This was not the case.  We were the ONLY table inside the restaurant and the service absolutely sucked.  How many times must one flag down the server for (take your pick) A;  refill on chips B: refill on ice water and C:(most importantly since the drinks are marked up 300%) a FRESH DRINK!!! Oh yes and D: Check please.  We had to look over our shoulders for A , B, C, and D.  When our table collectively decided the service was ridiculous we decided the tip would reflect that, and then we realized an 18% gratuity was included...well no wonder.  When that is the case, there is NO incentive for decent service!! We brought several items to the attention of the bald headed caucasian man who may have been a manager of some sort but his severe lack of customer service skills merely resulted in him stating in a childish voice ""They are complaining about the service"" to an audience that didnt exist.  Damn right! and damn right we will take our business elsewhere.  Grandma Chavez is rolling in her grave! you should be ashamed!"|0
Great food can be found anywhere. Great service is one in a million these days. This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, don't even bother going. You'll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day.  It's simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I can't help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received.   I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole' prime rib. We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that we'd like to order off the special evening menu where it's a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that it's our first time. Wrong thing to do. I don't know if it's because past Groupon-ers don't tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant.   It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isn't to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasn't her fault and there's no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should.   Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didn't even want to see her face so another random server brought it back.  We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didn't even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didn't even care at that point.   To be honest, I can't even remember what the food tasted like, which isn't quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. I'm pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did.  Maybe it wasn't even the Groupon. Who knows. All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it.|0
"I am leaving this store angry and can't resist writing a review!   The staff is incredibly useless....if you can actually find someone to help you. The store is huge with very little signs to guide you. Therefore I always wander aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped in for (even though I tell myself I will never go back) with no one to help me.   Today they were out of an item I bought last week and need more of to finish my project. I asked the only 100 year old lady I could find to check the back and she told me they have nothing in back and to ask customer service. The lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she handed me their number and said ""well you can call them"". I stormed out soooo mad and this time I promise to never go back. Hobby Lobby or Michaels is worth the drive!!!"|0
I've never had a hard time at a sonic before, except for this location. They barely speak English, they don't know their own menu, and they messed up my order 2 times. Come on, your job can not be that confusing...|0
"This may be my worst dining experience ever.  The scenery was beautiful, we can't complain about that. The menu was decent, there was a good number of selections to choose from. However the prices were definitely high, we're just talking tacos & burritos here...  I ordered a taco salad with steak. It was $11.99, for lunch...which I thought was crazy.  When I got the salad, it was the cheap iceberg lettuce, with a couple tomatoes & a few onions. The steak was DISCUSTING. I wouldn't feed a dog that steak meat. I asked the waiter for some salad dressing, he gave me this funny look and said ""most people just use salsa, but I guess I can get you some ranch or something"". Great service, huh? I asked the waiter about the margarittas, and he willingfully told me that the 3 cheapest ones are no good and are too watered down. Nice...so I then asked about the Patron Margaritta (my fav tequilla). The Patron rita was $16!!!   The waiter was extremely unprofessional, and even gave us this pitch about how he's only working there until he finds a new ""gig"". The prices were ridiculous! I would NEVER go there again and hope to share my story with many people before they waste their money!!"|0
"Mediocre, bland, low quality food topped off with painfully slow service.  I worked in the neighborhood and continued to return occasionally ""just in case it's gotten better"", for reasons I could never fathom once the plate of abysmal food was placed on the table.  The salsa and rice are usually good, but that's the most I have to offer."|0
"I was very disappointed in my encounter with them today.  I have been going there for years and thought they have done a good job.  Today I picked up my Tori Burch purse that I brought in to have a shoulder strap repaired.  The thread they used for the repair was a light cream color.  The purse and the stitching is a mustard yellow color.  It looks terrible!!!  They tried putting some cream colored shoe polish on the tread, no improvement.  Now the thread just looked dirty.  I told them that I was not at all happy with the repair.  They just kept saying in thick accent.  ""It's good, I fixed it good"".  They would not refund the amount I prepaid,  (prepay only store), or redo it with the correct color thread.  Just kept saying.  ""I fixed it good"".  Looks like I'll be finding a new shoe repair place."|0
I will never make another purchase from this company ever again! The company tried to deliver damaged furniture to my home and then gave me the run around about processing a refund when I refused to accept the items. After 5 phone conversations, they agreed to refund me for refusing damaged items. I cannot recommend this to anyone.|0
Ugh. I don't like giving a tough review, but this is a store that needs to address a couple things.  1. The Service: Long lines and unpleasant cashiers.  2. Outdated Store: This wouldn't be so obvious if they just did a little cleanup and merchandising. 3. Produce: Maybe in this store they should just no offer produce. The little corner in the store makes you think it was an afterthought.   I think just a couple things that wouldn't cost much money would go a long way in making this store a go to place for me. Not there right now.|0
AWFUL.  Not sure it classifies as food.  Burrito consists of a flour tortilla and meat.  No salsa, beans, cheese, sour cream, guacamole.  Nada.  Plus they won't let you add anything to it.  Everything is as is.  The cheese enchalada had cheese but it was not gooey and melted.  The food was barely luke warm.   Service is also mediocre.  The salsa was gross.  It was super water down.  The best part of the meal was my Pepsi.|0
I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.   When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously.  Don't bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.    And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY I'M-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!  YOU'RE NOT THAT COOL!|0
when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.  well, i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY.   it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...  our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'  then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.  i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird.   we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had.   as we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing.   awful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in.   if wal-mart ran a restaurant, this would be it.|0
I was going to take the time to write a scathing review, but I honestly can't even bring myself to do it. 1 star. That's all I can say.|0
"beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you don't drink tea?  really.  The crazy thing is, i'm sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill?  When I mentioned it to the cashier, she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  ""oh, is this your 1st time?  we can remove it from the bill""  I said forget it, keep it.  i usually tip 20-30% but i'll just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.    yeah, really worth losing a customer for?  my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water.  gone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?)  $2.35 PER so now they're no different from the rest of the dim sum places.  as sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers)  so in a down economy, you're supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges?  it's the chinese way i guess  back to china king for us.  sorry china king for being disloyal with having a brief and sordid affair with the palace.  will you forgive us? haha"|0
"Still quite poor both in service and food. maybe I made a mistake and ordered Sichuan Gong Bao ji ding for what seemed like people from canton district. Unfortunately to get the good service U have to speak Mandarin/Cantonese. I do speak a smattering but try not to use it as I never feel confident about the intonation.   The dish came out with zichini and bell peppers (what!??)  Where is the peanuts the dried fried red peppers and the large pieces of scallion. On pointing this out all I got was "" Oh you like peanuts.. ok I will put some on"" and she then proceeded to get some peanuts and sprinkle it on the chicken.  Well at that point I was happy that atleast the chicken pieces were present else she would probably end up sprinkling raw chicken pieces on it like the raw peanuts she dumped on top of the food.   Well then  I spoke a few chinese words and the scowl turned into a smile and she then became a bit more friendlier.   Unfortunately I do not condone this type of behavior. It is all in poor taste..."|0
I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood.  I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasn't paying cash or using a Shell credit card.  Yes, there are signs on the pump but, really, who would think to look for such a requirement?  I've been buying gas for over 40'years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.  I, and my children, their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.  How disappointing and dishonest.|0
Will never eat here again. Sandwich was meteocre and overpriced. On top Of that I was charged more than I was told the total was. Horrible first time experience!|0
Everything about this company sucks. Walmart treats their customers and employees horribly, I mean HORRIBLY! They destroy the communities in which they sit. I'm done, never shopping here again, I don't care how cheap something might be, there is a high cost to low prices afterall...|0
Sadly, I have to join the crowd on this one. I was hoping that Kitchen 56 would make my memories of Vatra go away, but instead just reminded me all over again. Food was WAY overpriced and just OK. Kudos to Eddie the Server who brought with him the only charm available the second time we tried K56; I'd give him 4 stars if the review were based solely on his service & personality. I will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation, but the spots (lights) at the counter-height 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last call...and I don't drink.|0
Nasty workers and over priced trash|0
"I really enjoy writing reviews praising a place for great food, service, ambiance, and value, or any combination of these. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those reviews.   This is a fish story... No, not about the big one that got away. Nor is it about the time I was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water.... this is about the trout that saved the day.  When my wife and I arrived at the Greene House, it was earlier in the evening, still happy hour, though we were there for dinner not appetizers. Checked-in with the hostess and were quoted a  quoted 30-45 minute wait for a table. We knew the place was popular so weren't upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner.  Went to the bar to order wine and that's when our disappointment started. We were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were TWO bartenders,  In spite of this, in the 15 minutes we waited, occasionally waving and saying ""excuse me"" to get the bartenders' attention, we never even got so much as a Hi, and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink.  I had only just told my wife I wasn't willing to wait another 15-30 minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready. Our relief was short lived however.  After being seated, it was approximately 5 minutes before our server came to the table. We ordered wine and water.  Our wine and water came NINE minutes later... a total of over 30 minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage.  We skipped an appetizer, planning ahead for dessert, and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Approximately 15 minutes later, our SIDE of Truffle Parmesan Fries showed up... sans trout.   When asked about the missing trout, she said it'd be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up. When asked why she brought the side of fries, she said she thought we wanted them first, a leap of logic that totally escaped us.   When our server said she could take the fries back ""to keep them warm until our trout was ready"", my wife and I looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now STARVING, our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner.  Finally, a few minutes after our Truffle Parmesan Fries were gone, our trout arrived. As I indicated in the begining, it saved the day. The fish was fresh, perfectly prepared and exceptional.  As good as the trout was however, is wasn't good enough to make us ever return to the Greene House. There is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a 2 mile radius of this one (much less dozens more throughout the Phoeniz metro area), that are SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable.   Spend your hard earned money somewhere else"|0
Went last night to Whore Foods to get basics to make pizza with, most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast. Low and behold, the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didn't put something in the bag.  And this time it was the yeast.  I love the food there, but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who can't be bothered to do their goddamn jobs! I am so sick of this crap with this corporation. Maybe its a Phoenix thing, or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods, but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods. In a place like Phoenix, where you have alternatives such as Sprouts, you'd think Whore Foods would smarten up.  Or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is, and they just walk by with their nose high in the air. I understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that you're a super star, but I don't work with you, I contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk, so do your goddamn job. Useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist.   But alas, Whore Foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for.  Oh yea, one other thing, take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores. It didn't stop Jared Loughner from doing something horrid, and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their Constitutional rights. I understand you think that only parts of the Constitution should apply, but honestly I think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower.  Useless motherf*&#$@s!|0
Read al lthe hype, so decided to give Cyclo a try.  What a disappointment!  Portions were small and overpriced, owner thinks she's the next best thing to sliced bread.  She needs to go back to Vietnam to remember how real Vietnamese food is prepared.  Give this place a miss.|0
OMG! what is the rave about? this place is disgusting! it's dirty and the food is not worth it! i came here with my family and we each order a little bit of everything that is suppose to be good and popular there. unfortunately everything is bad. i walked by the waiters and they were all cursing really loud in vietnamese to each other. the table is icky and it smell like my cooked up oil . ick! go to Pho ao sen instead at least it's clean.|0
"The staff of this ""establishment"" are some of the rudest, most condescending individuals I have ever met in my life. They will not give you ANY money, and you will have much better luck at Sunset Clothing Exchange, which is right up the street (Plus they actually have friendly staff). The people who are buying the clothes should not be buyers; judging from the way that they style themselves, they know nothing about fashion whatsoever. Everyone who has stated that you will not get any money from them for designer items is right... they would much rather have trite, ""trendy"" studded vests from Target than a pair of Miu Miu sunglasses.  I was there about a year ago, and one of their young female employees was laughing, snarking and making faces at me. I had no idea who she was. It got to the point where my friend actually pulled her aside and said something. Today, their manager called me something that I can't even print on here. I had never seen him in my life, either. I have never done anything to these people except for sell my clothes to them.  Avoid this place at all cost, they should change the name to Juggalo Exchange."|0
This location is now closed.|0
We came here for dinner for me and reverse happy hour for my wife, we ordered our appetizers and after finishing them and looking over the menu for a few minutes we were ready to jump into the overpriced entrees. We were then informed that we couldn't order dinner. Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for dinner...they might give them a heads up that the kitchen Is closing so we can order our meals and not be told five minutes after it did close..fourth time we've given this place a and got crappy service. Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner, Needless to say we won't be giving them another chance. Not good Gordon B. Not good.|0
After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere  to get my acrylics done. I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips. After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place. The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them. I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them. Don't waste your time here.|0
My husband and I went there for our first time today. What a mistake. First of all, the ladies bathroom had no soap or paper towels to wash/dry your hands. My husband had the steak sandwich and I had the chicken ranch. There was so little meat on the sandwiches that we were perplexed when we were finished.  The inside trash was overflowing. I have been sick to my stomach the last hour....never again.|0
"NOOOO!!!  Don't think about it!!!!  Had my windshield replaced by these schmucks. The morons tore up the interior of my car, and damaged a speaker cover.   I had to call them about replacing the cover thrice, they finally did, and then I found out that there was a HUGE air leak in the corner. They never fixed the interior trim.  They sent out the same first idiots to plug the leak, and they ended up breaking a ton of clips for a covering on my car, ruining the windshield wiper covers, and DOUSING my tweeter in water. I called immediately after they left and got harassed by a ""manager"" because he just had hip surgery (why is this my fault?!) and couldnt come until a week out!  Whatever incentives they offer are not worth the TERRIBLE craftsmanship and poor service.  I am exploring my options with a lawyer, and have reported them to BBB."|0
"I called The Town Dump to ask if I could come in this week and interview them for an English paper about a small local business, and the owner was just incredibly rude. She didn't even let me finish telling her it would take five minutes of her time, preferring to interject and tell me to go somewhere else. When I explained that I've heard wonderful things about their business from friends, and that that sparked my interest, she said, ""Well, go somewhere else."" I've never even been inside, and I sure as hell won't go now. Maybe it's just me, but I don't like shopkeepers who snarl at their customers."|0
I had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here. I had been to Johnny Rocket's before and gotten the vegan option so I knew I would be ok going here. I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want.   We get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA.   About 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)  I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience.   All I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat. Stress that to them. Because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is.|0
The worst Thai food I've ever had! This place was recommended to us by another couple, and wow was I disappointed!  Everything was completely blase and tasteless, the only exception being the extreme spiciness of my fiance's entree(probably to make up for the lack of other spices)...  don't bother with this place.|0
An upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me. I planned my visit for a quieter evening, and reviewed the menu again and again.   However, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy, and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory.    We were seated immediately.   Our waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is).   Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls.   When the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately, we took our grub with us. I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily. Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal, though, we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand.   Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right, but since I am recommending that you not go there, why bother?|0
I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.  They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line.   Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.  Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.  I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR.|0
"A couple Saturdays ago, went with my mom to get my name added to her accounts should the unthinkable happen. We first went to Chase which took all of ten minutes. The personal banker was great - in-out-done.  Then we headed to her Credit Union at approximately 10:00 AM. They were quite busy, apparently. When we checked in, I heard grumbling from other customers and asked the wait time.  I was told there were two people ahead of us in line and it ""shouldn't be long.""  30 minutes later, my mom went to ask how much longer it would take. Jennfer, who was manning the reception desk, dismissed her rudely in front of a lobby of customers. My mom is as sweet as tea in Tennesee, so to hear her called out in front of a lobby of people as a disruption was upsetting.  45 minutes later, I went up to ask if it would be much longer. Jennifer said curtly, ""We're busy."" Apparently, on Saturdays, they're busy and one should avoid transacting business there on the weekend. I don't recall being spoken to so rudely at even a fast food restaurant in recent years...  Another ten minutes or so went by (as did my deadline to make another appointment I had made), I was told it would be ""two more minutes"", as I had to go through their background check to be a member. They were having a difficult time with my Washington Driver License and the weird characters it has (an asterisk in part of the number). After all was said and done, over an hour later, I was approved to be a member and was successfully put as a signer on my mom's account.  I asked for Jennifer's card, as I told her I was not happy with the way she had spoken to me or my mother, and I intended to speak with her manager.  To that I received a reply she did not have one. The woman sitting next to her informed me she was the assistant manager and that they were busy on Saturdays. My biggest beef was this: If it was going to be an hour to speak with someone, tell me. I can make other arrangements or come in during the week. Being told first, ""It shouldn't be long,"" and then, ""We're busy"" is not an excuse. If the business is so overwhelming on Saturdays, perhaps it would be wise to staff more people, extend the hours, or inform people of the wait they're likely to experience because of the queue. Or don't open on Saturdays!  As a 20 year veteran of the service industry, I am very disappointed at the level of service Arizona Federal Credit Union provided my mom and me, but also all the other people I watched be dismissed like the Credit Union was doing them a favor. After doing some searching for a new home for mom's money, she can get a much better rate at a (four letter word forthcoming) BANK!  I'm normally a big fan of member-owned institutions, but based on the incredibly rude serviced I received from Arizona Federal Credit Union, I'd say go to a Credit Union or Bank where the employees actually read the mission statement that is painted on the wall behind them."|0
Entering the store is visually overwhelming. There were so many things take in, I thought I'd found my new grocery store.  I wandered for a good 40 mins checking everything out....  After the ether wore I began to realize something. While the selection was wide, it look OLD.  I raced to the fresh fish and noticed that even packed in ice their little fish eyeballs where cloudy and sunken into the sockets.  I looked at the frozen section and found some fish that had a sell by date of 02/2010. There was other fish that was packed by the store  with no packed on or sell by dates. There was canned and boxed food past their expiration date.  I checked out this place on the Maricopa County health department and they had their fare share of customer complaint driven inspections.|0
Ok food. Super slow!! 3 employees and 2 customers and I could not believe how long it took for a quesadlla which was cold when I got it...the tacos were decent though....Give it a try and you decide though..|0
"This place is the classic bait and switch joint.  I ordered through the drive-thru and told the person I was ordering that I had a coupon for a ""buy one-get one free"" Chicken Tender Sandwich,  The bun was hard and not at all like the picture on the coupon. The two small tenders were extremely rubbery and looked like they had been retrieved from the trash can after they had been tossed for being under a heat lamp too long. The lettuce was the part that most people toss when cleaning and the tomatoes were thin and pale and looked like they had been genetically mutated . . .uhh, I mean grown.  This wasn't the first time the server manager did this to me. I should have known better. I used a coupon a while back there for a buy one, get one free breakfast burrito and asked that they prepare it to look like the picture that appeared on the coupon. My bad!  When I got down the road and reached into the bag to take a bite, the cook had apparently taken an onion and diced it up super fine and threw that in with it.  If you want a decent hamburger or chicken sandwich without attitude and that looks as advertised or better, go to smash burger. As for this place, never, never  again.  The only good Carl's Jr. I have found in the valley so far is off the Superstition (Hwy 60) and Tomahawk.  From the Manager down, they strive to live up to their advertising."|0
Pho-yuck this place!   I was tricked in to going here with promises of great Vietnamese. I was ready for a culinary adventure and what I got was a ride in the fright house.   The Bánh xèo was so greasy I couldn't eat it, it was literally served on a plate of grease.   The bun was about the same. It lacked flavor, the rice noodles were slimy, the spring roll was loaded with grease.   I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass.  The service was horrible and I will not be back.|0
Disclaimer: I am a Thai person and a Thai food connoisseur.   This is supremely average Thai food and overpriced as heck to take advantage of White People. Sorry to be blunt but that's all it is. $18 dishes that are $8 at a real Thai restaurant. The spring rolls were very bland and came with only a tiny bit of sauce for dipping. They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers. They dont have.  If you like spicy, skip it for sure. Again this is what we would call Tourist Thai back in Thailand.   Tiny servings.  The good. Friendly wait staff.  If authentic Thai is what you're looking for try any of these: Palees Crown, Tum Nak Thai or Royal Thai Grill.|0
Most horrible buffet I have ever been to.  My boyfriend and I are big chinese buffet fans. A ton of them have raised their prices recently (and, not surprisingly, have been closing down left and right).. so the prospect of a good buffet at 5-8 dollars was absolutely amazing. We read all the reviews on yelp and I had high hopes.  Dear lord. The food is awful here. Inedible. Tastes very distinctly like a bad frozen dinner.  The only thing I remember being remotely food-like was some kind of beef and onion dish.. which tasted a bit like a philly cheesesteak. not exactly asian fare..  I tried really hard to like this place. My boyfriend didn't like any of it either. I don't understand how they have such good ratings. The ONLY thing I like about this place is their dessert bar, because they have toppings for the frozen yogurt. It always annoyed me how so many buffets don't even have sprinkles.. so they've got that going for them.. though I think I'll just go to Mojo or Yogurtland. haha.  In short, I don't understand how anyone can eat this garbage.|0
Just isn't very good.  I don't understand why people give this place even three stars.  It's rare for me to give a place a low rating, but, My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse.   The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like.  I've been to this place several times over the years.  This location and others.   It used to be just on the lower end of OK...  it's never been as good as you can get from a 'Ma and 'Pa place.  However, we went for lunch the other day and it's just gotten to the point I wouldn't even go back for a quick bite.  We ordered the garlic hummus, and it was overly full of garlic and not home made.  It seemed to be loaded with garlic powder, as opposed to fresh hummus that just had roasted garlic in it.   The olives we ordered were rough at best.  UGH even thinking about them.  Overly seasoned and not very fresh.   The rice was over cooked and was so soft it lacked any sort of texture.  The first rule of good let, alone great food, is FRESH.   This place needs a rescue.  Less critical, but, I think an overall representation of what has happened to the place, the menu's were totally trashed.   As in ratty, tattered, and dirty.  The lamination was coming off them and they were dirty.   Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.|0
We ordered.  I had to return my chicken tenders.  Undr cooked and rubbery.  My wife ordered a hamburger and is now home throwing it up.  what a horrible experience.  We have been huge fans and now this?  I called and spoke with someone who barely has a grasp on our language and they said they would get right back to me.  Still waiting My wife is in bed looking so sick.  We will never return!!|0
"Great in its day, now leaves a lot to be desired.  Deserves credit as a Phoenix landmark Chinese restaurant.    This restaurant has been here for 38 years.  I've been going here off and on for 35 years.  I go here more for sentimental reasons, and not so much for the food.    The interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago.  The rest of the decorations have been torn out.  I believe the decor is modeled after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing - see the vault-of-the-heavens style crenelations in the ceiling.    I have this restaurant - in its former self - to thank for this:  Back in its day, this restaurant was really great, and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years.   Sadly, the food here is not all that good.  The fryer oil they use here is pretty old.  The fried rice arrives looking almost black (from the fryer oil?  too much soy sauce?) instead of a rich golden brown, and tastes overcooked somehow.  The eggrolls are just OK.  Definitely not fresh.  A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special ""Chinese cakes"" served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food.  All of this is gone, and replaced by very plain fare, and not very good at that.    If you like salty, greasy, plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety, then go here.  Golden Phoenix's heyday as a great restaurant is long-gone.  Let us bow our heads in sadness to a place that once was very good - now passed on..."|0
Absolutely waste of time & space is this establishment. Don't bother checking in with the host to be seated as I saw many people just seat themselves although there was a 20 min wait for others, the staff rude, uncaring & could possibly be where all the servers go that can't get a job in any other Resteraunt. A complete disgrace & I would never give such a place my hard earned money, I suggest you do the same.|0
One stop has one goal and that is to get the $80. diagnosis fee and split.  Francisco told me i needed to spend over $1300. for parts the manufacturer only charges $316 for. Stay away! I intend to file a complaint with the Attorney Generals office today, hopefully they will stop this nonsense.|0
Yikes, reading other reviews I realize my bad experience wasn't unique. As a server I make a very laid back customer. I like pretty much everything I eat and don't require a lot of attention from the waiter.   La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person!   I left super stressed out from the experience, which is very, very unusual for me. You can either have bad service or bad food, but not both.|0
First, I hope La Fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant.  Second, we miss the bloody mary bar too.  Hubby & I visited LF a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner. We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong.  Okay, she doesn't know beer.  We liked the chips & salsa, it was a good start, then I took a sip of my water.  What the?  I know what Tempe tap water tastes like, but this was weird.  The aftertaste made me cringe, I couldn't drink it, even with a slice of lemon in it, maybe it was the ice.  Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas, which he orders practically everywhere, and it was so bad he didn't finish it.  My meal was not memorable either.  I wanted to love this place, or at least like it.  We walked out of there terribly disappointed, I doubt we'll go back.|0
Bad quality ingredients. I ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful, hard, I tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up.|0
The staff at this location was rude and unfriendly!! Also the store itself was not the cleanest I have seen!|0
F724   She didn't even look at me, didn't bother asking why I was entering her place of business, didn't reply when I spoke and in no way acknowledged that I was even in her presence. Just handed me a ticket and was done with me. If this happened anywhere else, I would make an effort to never return, tell all my friends how horrible this experience was, and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business. Sadly, this was my Saturday morning at the DMV, a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell. With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell, it's politicians campaigning around me).   So, I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early. Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays, they gave me a map. How precious. I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously? Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?) After receiving such a magnificent welcome, I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life. To simplify what was so bad, let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public:   1) Bathe. The combination of water and soap, along with massaging the skin, creates an outcome that is most pleasing. Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html   2) Sit still. Yes, I know we're all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster. Trust me, I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious, get up and walk around.   3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car. It's winter, they'll be fine. It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me.   4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me, I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker.   5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah, I get it. I'm not that big. In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear. But, I'm still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level.   Oh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it.   Oh, and F724 was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship).    Le sigh...   Open T-Sa 8:00am - 5:00pm; information only after 4:30pm|0
Horrible service. Barely acknowledged when you first walked in. Slow service and waited for my check for 20 minutes before getting up to go get it myself. Will not come again.|0
What.  The.   Heck. ??    Be prepared for sticker shock!  I walked in, through the store, and made a hasty straight line back to exit.  And over and across the road to Crate & Barrel  - Ahhhhhh - much better!  Whew!|0
While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door.   We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties.   Since we were still unable to get her attention,  we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street.|0
"Here's a thought, don't post on the door to your restaraunt ""Up scale Mexican Food"" unless you can prove it.  This was not upscale, it was barely pass-able  as decent.  Didn't help that the waitress got both of our orders wrong.  Will not return."|0
This place was horrible! I will never go back it was over priced and the best thing I ate was the corn bread you get  before the meal.  I had the chorizo stuffed tenderlion it was like chewing on a piece of rubber stuffed with soy. My girl freind had  flavorless tacos with stale corn tortillas. three  words it sucked, sucked, sucked!|0
"I am a huge tea drinker, so when I found out about Teavana I was excited.  I entered the store and an employee asked if I cared to try some tea. After sampling several different blends, I chose three to purchase.  The employee asked if I wanted to get a large canister for a dollar more than the one I had picked. Not realizing this store sells tea by the ounce rather than per canister, I said ""sure."" He chatted as he filled the containers, never mentioning the price, and once done took my debit card and rang me up. I didn't pay attention to the cost and when I looked at the receipt when I got home my heart nearly stopped. I spent $350 on tea. I returned it and they didn't give me too much trouble. Now I always check the total before handing my card over, and I won't go back. I feel like they totally swindled me."|0
They wouldn't honor pet co's online sale prices.  That's the first time I've heard about this.|0
"If I could give zero stars, I would.  I have never spent more time looking for a bar than I have looking for this. And not like a cool underground dance club in L.A.  When we finally found this sh*thole sandwiched between two vacant businesses, it was barely visible.  The sign for it looked like it was written with a sharpie on a piece of cardboard and someone duct tapped a flashlight to it.  Before we even entered the bar, as my friend and I were walking up two redneck bikers whispered, ""Fags"" as we walked by them.  I don't think these were the kind of guys you argued with so I let it go.  When we entered the bar I noticed several ""No firearms"" signs plastered on the walls.  I'm assuming they've had a problem with this before.  Remember that scene in the Blues Brothers where they go to the country bar and get the look of death from the patrons?  That's how I felt.  The decor of this bar was interesting.  It looked as if they got the tables and chairs from an old 70s Vegas casino.  The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so getting a seat is pretty much impossible.  We went to the bar to do some karaoke, but apparently they also sell crappy jewelry for some reason?  Weird.  I've also never heard so much cussing from karaoke singers.  One of the drunken hicks actually got into a shouting match with one of the morbidly obese toothless tattooed bicker chicks where they argued who was the bitch and who was the pussy.  Halfway through my beer, my friends showed up and they refused to go inside so I ran away and never looked back.  TIP: If you go here wear a black leather jacket, bandana and Harley Davidson gear."|0
If it wasn't for the bad food I would go here more than once or twice a year.  The meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second. Now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie, I order a salad only. Because they do catering, I have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers.    The service is OK. They have a couple of generic draft beers. Everything is overpriced.  Caveat Emptor if you order an entree.|0
This was the best camera/photography store in the valley.  It has now been re-imagined and renamed as Photomart upon its move to Scottsdale.  I recently visited the new location...and I was shocked!  The store was extremely small, had very little to sell (I didn't even see a camera on display).  They did carry some glass...but mostly a very small selection of accessories.  I didn't even recognize any of the former employees.    I encourage all the former loyal Photomark customers to visit Photomart.  I'm sure you will leave disappointed.  Two thumbs down to this lemon!|0
I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night. Service was excellent, and highly attentive. Food, absolutely horrible.  My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye.  What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered.  What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style.  Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet Veggies, blah. Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh.   In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English.   I've had it with this place. If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle|0
Slowest DRIVE THRU ever!!!! Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location.  I frequented this location around dinner time since it is the closest to my home a few times and every time it is between a 10-15 min ordeal. When i worked at Mickey D's in the early 90's we had what was called 90 sec HBO( Hand Bag Out), from order to picking up should be no longer than 90 secs. This must not be a practiced any longer.  I have to say hello when I drive up to the speaker due to getting no response. Then I get someone who is rude and say's yes. I order the big mac deal, buy 1, get 1 for a $1. The employee says they do not offer that, I advise their menu out front does. After 5 min of silence and cars backing up I pull fwd to make sure he is still living to see what is up. Total lack of cust serv service, he had to have the mgr show him how to ring it up, no apology or anything. This happened each time I went there. C'mon man|0
Not worth the money. Food was average and the portion was small for the price I paid.|0
Never Again, I brought my Mountain Bike in (which I bought 1 week earlier from Walmart) to have them replace my flat inner tubes with puncture resistant tubes.)  I came back 20 minutes later when they said it would be done and as I rode away, the back tire rhythmically rubbed against the back brake.  When I returned and told them about it, I was told the back wheel was not true.  It was true for the whole short week since I purchased it from Walmart.  I plan to take it to their competitor (Landis) and pay the extra $15-$25) to have the wheel put back to the straight condition it was in when I brought it to Slippery Pig in the first place.   I would never give a shop another penny for an extra service I should never have needed on a brand new bike which coasted perfectly when I brought it in.|0
Bitzee Mama's isn't my mama! My mama wouldn't have kept her hungry son waiting forever for his lunch. She wouldn't have let my go thirsty with no refills. She does make a good bowl of salsa so that makes it alright, right?   Took my real mama there for lunch.. I ordered the taco salad and ma ordered the cheese enchilada plate.. also a bowl or red chile. Taco salad was alright except the taco shell was so mushy from water it literally fell apart when I picked it up.. glad I wasn't eating the shell. She's old school.. makes a darn good cheese enchilada and refried beans. Struck out again with the red chile.. I swear, can no one except La Canasta make red chile? While the meat was tender and the sauce was smooth it had a weird orange color to it and the meat tasted, well wasn't any beef Ive ever had.   On the way to the counter to pay my bill I noticed that almost everyone was eating chimichanga's.. well then, looks like I ordered the wrong thing! Place is also uber cheap.   Be careful what you order and mama will be just fine.|0
This was a terrible experience.  You can not reach anyone via phone, you have to book online, which I did and also requested a phone call.  I rcvd no call and had an email in my email confirming a time for cleaning.  I requested a call then and got a reply stating someone would call me in 15 mins.  Still no call.  The cleaners arrived & I had someone let them in.  When I returned they were to clean the bathrooms & they were TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!  The sinks were dirty, with tooth paste splatters on sink, the inside of the shower had brown marks from some sort of un rinsed product.  I am so unhappy about this.  I have tried to reach them every day since & have not recieved a call back from a voice mail or email.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE AWEFUL!|0
"what can I say about Glam... well, i really, really despise it. Every time I go there, I regret the decision. And in my grandiose style, I'm going to say why in a list:  1) Cash only!! But listen to this, the bartender will take your debit card, charge you a fee, and give you cash, which you can then use to buy drinks from the same bartender that just did the whole transaction. WHY????   2) The location kinda blows. It's in a weird strip mall across from another strip mall. Have you ever driven by there in the day time? It's shady then, imagine at night time.  3) too hipster. I feel like I am not allowed there as I work for the man, do not wear black leggings, or have razor cut bangs. I, in my mall clothing and ""mainstream"" style, stick out like a sore thumb.  4) The music is just a little off.... ii dunno how to say what I am thinking, it's just off.  Okay, the floor is fancy. That's about it.  (sorry, I'm a bar snob and Glam deserves my wrath)"|0
Goddess got it right.  This place is pretty, and it looks so promising.  Big disappointment.   There was nothing for vegetarians.  The food was mediocre at best.  I'd choose Pho Nhat over this pretty restaurant any day.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  No good.|0
Once again, THE TROUGH SLURPERS offer far too many stars to this mundane eatery, proving again that they are truly CANAILLE of the first order.: Slow indifferent service Mediocre food The kind of wine that patrons of kokopelli swill with delight, calling it ambrosia when it's actually dishwater. But..as with Kokopelli, it keeps the shit eaters out of the better restaurants! So, I say to you canaille..flock, flock there with your disruptive screaming children and your leathery palates.|0
It was my Birthday and my wife, her mom, a dear friend and I headed to Fleming's Steakhouse in Chandler, AZ. We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That, we did, unfortunately.   The restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish? In short, we left hungry and wondering why we spent over $200 for the entire meal.  Next time, we'll go to a well tried place for steaks and more. Durant's, downtown Phoenix and worth the drive.|0
My wife and I have going to this restaurant on Thursday night for past three months to have a beer and a slice.  A couple weeks ago I went there for the usual but there was an NFL game and a World series game on and the restaurant was busy.  I put my name in and waited for my wife and the table.  30 minutes went by and wife had not shown up and the table had just become available.  Hostess said I can't seat you unless your other party shows up first.  I called my wife, she cancelled.  Hostess would not seat me as a single...TERRIBLE..Hostess did not tell me this when I first put my name in.  WON'T BE GOING TO ANY OF THE ZIPPS EVER AGAIN.|0
Everytime I have gone in this store I have left feeling like a big pile of poop. The staff is sooo horrible. I read the other reviews and it seems to be a common thing which really sucks because I would probably shop here a lot more if the staff wasn't a bunch of pricks. P.S. I found a skirt at Target for $10 that is EXACTLY like one they carry, except they want $40 dollars and your soul.|0
I went for family birthday on a Friday night. Only a few people in dining room eating. (1st clue to leave.) Ordered a margarita. It's extra to have it shaken... But I ordered that way. It was mostly sour mix. An it was awful (How do you mess up a margarita?(2nd clue to leave) Server is surprised we wanted to order dinner! (3rd clue to run!) Very disappointing. I got the chicken fajitas, they had sauce all over them. Shrimp appetizer consists of 3 shrimp $8. Salsa was good.  I will never go back. Good luck Salty. I love your decor. Why don't you care you could be so cool!|0
"I had not been to an Oregano's in like 10 years. They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try, so why not.  I'll tell you ""Why NOT""... we has two thin crust pizzas... and I even hate to call them that. More like... crackers with melted cheese and some toppings.  That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had. Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like, at all, delivery pizza.  Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!  It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced ""gourmet"" pizza joint.  If you want expensive, and good, pizza there are many good alternatives... Pizzeria Bianco, Grimaldi's, etc."|0
Can someone please tell me why people go here???  Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because it's a holiday week.  That doesn't excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldn't take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes.  Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.  I'm sure if the service had been better, I wouldn't be so miserable right now. My food coma isn't satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad.   Total. Fail. Blech.|0
They have some rude employees its unbelievable. I'm trying to give business to them and ordered 6 smoothies and the cashier and her employee gave me a dirty look. Not customer friendly. At all.|0
Wow this place was steps below horrible. I should have known better considering the place was empty on ASU game night. The food was greasy, and flavorless. Everything on the plate was flat... Ya I said it.... Flat. Bland, disappointing food. Save your money and eat at taco bell. You will thank me later.|0
"I used to go here at least 3 times a week for Happy hour.  The volcano chicken was my favorite meal.  However, the last time I was in there I had a cricket in my water.  I took a sip squeezed the lemon, and thought there was something wrong with the taste.  I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no, sure enough it was a cricket (in which i took a picture).  The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive.  One of the male bartenders came over and brought a new water saying, ""It happens.""  No, sorry that's disgusting.  If i hadn't been craving the volcano chicken I went there for I would have just left.  And then on top of getting a cricket in my water there's no discount or compensation off of my bill."|0
I had the misfortune of stopping by this establishment today with two things, a skirt and a cloth handbag. I asked the woman at the counter if I could have some very minor stitching done on a cloth purse. She looked it over for about 3 seconds and said 'Oh no I don't see how this could be repaired'. (what I wanted sewn were two little pom poms attached to the cloth strap that were loose and I wanted them to be stitched on there tighter). Not a difficult task. She then told me that she could maybe 'send it out' and have it stitched but it would take a week or more to get it back. WHAT??! I then asked her about  the skirt which I wanted cleaned and/or pressed with the tags attached (because I'm selling it). She said no that the tags would be destroyed in the process.  So I went to another dry cleaners and asked the same things for both the skirt and the bag. I was informed that what I wanted done would be no problem and that I could pick it up the next day.|0
I was there on a Friday night with a few friends in the hopes of a quick drink and nosh after a show next door. My companion and I ordered basic drinks and were met with shots of liquor in the bottoms of our glasses and a blank look from the waitress when I asked if they were out of mixers.  After this, we opted not to order any food (taking our cue from the inability to mix gin with tonic water) and were met with an outrageous bill (for our two 'well' shots).  We questioned the tally and were met with a second total that wasn't much better.   Our credit card was charged twice: $40 for some wet ice and a lemon wedge.  There are many cool and artsy places in Phx where we can catch live music and nosh with friends.  I'll pass this one up from now on.|0
Closed on Sunday?  Looks like you've not only lost my Sunday dollars, but my business on Monday through Saturday too.|0
"My co-workers and I refer to this place as ""Pizza n' Ants"".  The staff will be happy to serve you with bare hands, right after using the till.  Also, as the nickname suggests, there has been a noticable insect problem.     As if that could all be overlooked, the pizza isn't even good.  If you are in this part of town, go to Z Pizza or Slices for great pizza instead!"|0
"I wish they had a ""0"" star option too!  The service and food was awful. Just a bunch of kids running the place.  The place closes at 10pm but when we went in there at 8pm all the workers were too busy cleaning to go home early to help us.  The food was burnt  on one side and raw on the other. The manager was too busy flirting with the other help. We couldn't get drinks because all the glasses where dirty, we were told by our waitress. We asked for the manager before we left at 8:45 and was told he already went home for the evening. What kind of manager leaves a bunch of teenager to run the place?   NEVER GOING BACK!!!!"|0
"My fiance and I tried the place because of a Groupon.  We live in the same neighborhood and see the place all the time but the look of the place was never enough to draw us in.  There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.  It's in a strip mall and looks old.  At night, they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung.  When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor, no host station and no host.  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasn't a bar that I'd want to eat, drink and socialize at.  To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.  I'm already here...I don't need any more persuasion.  It's time for the Chef/owner to take down the ""look how good I was"" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look.  We were greeted by friendly gentleman who seated us on the main lower floor.  He handed us our menus and asked if he could get us something to drink.  There is no drink menu on the menu.  No beer list, no soda list, no liquid period.  We asked to see the wine list, which had only bottle prices and doesn't even hint that they sell wine by the glass.  Once I asked if they had beer and sold wine by the glass it was like we made a breakthrough.   The menu seems a bit outdated so I  went with the Lasagna, the basics.  While we sat waiting for our meal, the salads came.  Weird...the menu didn't mention anything about a salad nor did the waiter.   More lack of information from the menu.  Now on to the decor.  It is terribly outdated.  Tacky, bland, pale paint scheme, brass fixtures, mirrors and cliche wine bottles.  There were beautiful fresh flowers throughout which we really enjoyed.  I was unfortunately seated directly in front of two paintings both with a woman and a little girl drinking what appears to be wine.  I'm guessing they are personal family paintings but they are horribly out of place and bordering on creepy.  I couldn't take my eyes off of them and that distracted me throughout the night.  This place needs a makeover, new modern paint scheme and some updating on the artwork.  The lasagna came.  It was OK at best.  I tried my fiance's chicken genevese at it was horrible.  The chicken tasted like it was boiled which is an instant dish killer for me.  We did not take our leftovers.  We asked for the check and it came with a after dinner cordial which was a nice surprise and tasted delicious.   We won't be back.  To be honest Oregano's lasagna is better by far."|0
Don't bother with this place.  I had never been here, my husband and I decided to pick up some food to take home.  We ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, an assorted tempura appetizer, a lobster appetizer, and yakisoba.  When we got home the order was totally wrong. Instead of lobster we were given mussels (which were gross), instead of assorted tempura and shrimp tempura we only got assorted tempura with 2... that's right only 2 shrimp in the whole mix.  The yakisoba was the only part of the order they got right and it was not that great, pretty bland.  I love Japanese food and I was really excited to find a place near by and while we were waiting for our order we were excitedly planning to come back and have their sushi, but after this complete mix up and poor quality food there is no way I would trust them with anything raw.  Never going back, such a complete disappointment.|0
"I have been here a few times over the last 4 years and really liked it.  It was horrible on Saturday night (5/28).  I ordered the enchiladas with chicken.  When it arrived there were 3 tiny enchiladas with an ounce of cheese inside the soggy tortillas and the ""with"" chicken part apparently meant a few chunks of chicken would be tossed on top.  I was so disappointed, but starving so I ate it.  The guacamole was really disappointing too.  I don't think we will go back again."|0
I hadn't been to Fuddruckers for about 20 years... now I know why.  Cashier was nice and very helpful.  I ordered bacon cheese burger combo.  Fries were only warm, not hot.  Burger was not very tasty and it was full of gristle bits... you know the ones that stick between your teeth.  Lots of trash on the floor.  After we were finished, someone came to ask how things were.  I told here about the fries and she offered to get me more; I declined.  She offered a free dessert: I accepted.  In all, not a good experience, will probably be at least another 20 years before I go back.|0
"I dont understand how a second restaurant was opened on Tatum . My husband and gave these place too many chances and wach time the food was not impressive. The margaritas come from a stolen recipe from La Pinata Nueva , but too bad they didnt bring the recipes with them. I hope they get it "" that maybe if you put alittle quality in the food people will come back""."|0
07/09/2008   Just went there last week for the first, and last, time.  I read the good reviews, so I was expecting much more.  I am a first generation American; both my parents were German and came over in their 20's.  I lived there for a few years, have eaten German food all my life, and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years.  I really wanted to like this place, as there are not many German establishments around here, but this place was terrible!  We were the only people in the place at 2pm, and still had horrible service.  ???  We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come, she would forget things we had asked her for.  The waitress didn't understand German, as in the German MENU options, so I ordered from the menu using the English translations, and she was still confused. I had to POINT at the options.  YES, there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu.  The bread was stale, the schnitzel was hard, there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just ...disgusting.  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides????  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before, because that is exactly what it tasted like.  Plus, I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 3.50, but showed up on my bill as 5.00, etc.  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left, disappointed.  Waste of time and money, I will not return.  Maybe at dinner time things are better, but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH!  Yuck. Oh, and the website is outdated- wrong prices and discontinued menu items.|0
This was absolutely horrible. I got the supreme pizza with the mystery meats.  I threw it in the trash. I will wait until I get to my destination to eat. Horrible!!!|0
The owner has changed hands & this place isn't what it used to be.  If you want up to date paper & quality product...go to Scrap Happy OR Crop Girls!|0
"Glad this place has new ownership... I should probably remove the review below, Its really harsh and doesn't apply to the NEW establishment.  You have been warned ;)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Short Review:  THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS  Long Review: We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night. We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall.   The music: Good music, probably the only good thing about this place - if you're a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop, all night.   The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20's - early 30's (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh!  The atmosphere: small, crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables, but don't expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports, which I guess qualifies this place as a ""sports cafe""??   The service: OMG, we had one beer each and the ""line"" was retarded, over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight, just people crowding together, trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons, one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.  Weirdos!  If any of this appeals to you this is your place!   BTW her friend didn't show and we ended up going to Skip n Jan's to play some pool :o)  We had a great time there :o)"|0
Terrible rolls. The Dragon was so so. The California was bland and the Spicy Tuna was cat food. Seriously, it  looked like canned cat food and tasted horrible.|0
marginal sushi meets uncomfotable seating.  we used restaurant.com coupon and got stuck wtih an 18% tip...with no service, seriously???  felt scammed...think we actually spent more based on that tip than had we just paid full price.  avoid this one, just not worth it.|0
Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding.|0
Do not go to this car wash. I dropped my kids off at choir and thought I'd run in for a quick car wash. Oh no! They locked my keys in the car. I couldn't get On-Star to unlock my Suburban because it was under a huge canopy and couldn't get a signal. Instead of calling a locksmith, the car washers tried and tried to get in through the window. Thankfully my husband was able to leave work early, go retrieve the kids from choir practice, and then come rescue me at the car wash with a spare set of keys. I was trapped there over an hour!  The manager then had the audacity to get mad at me because I was upset at their incompetence. They didn't even comp the car wash!  If you go here, don't pay for your car wash until your car is done!|0
"Treated with complete disrespect. Worst service I have ever experienced.  After waiting to see the manager I was directed to an employee who committed slander towards me very loudly in front of everyone in the store. Then the manager stepped in, spoke robotically without listening and then was incredibly harsh in tone and told me to leave. He said, ""leave, get out, now""  ****************Don't go to this store/don't use verizon******************"|0
I purchased the Enotria groupon when it was released last year and had a horrible experience at the restaurant.  1) I ordered a cheese platter. The platter was very much overpriced at over $18.00. The most problematic thing is that Enotria ordered the food from another restaurant on Mayo Blvd and had it delivered to them. The same is true with Pizza. If you order pizza there, it will be delivered from another restaurant in the Mayo shopping plaza. Enotria is taking a significant markup on the food because they are paying another vendor for it. AVOID THIS!!  2) Another disturbing aspect of the visit was that we were served disproportionately small portion because we were using a groupon. We ordered two glasses of red wine. The waiter (who also happened to be the owner) served us a glass that was 1/3 of what is typically served.  The only positive aspect of Enotria is that they have a good selection of wines. To be sincere, you are much better off going to a more reputable establishment in the area like White Chocolate Grill.  Oh, also keep in mind that the current owner bought the restaurant over a year ago. It has changed ownership several times and the overall quality is suffering because of this.  AVOID.|0
"From my door, it's a five minute stroll through the greenbelt to Dukes. They have a nice patio. They have enough TVs to show all MLB/NFL/NBA games. They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables. Yet, I've only been to Duke's a few times and I am not going back. This place is just bad.  Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when they're on ""special.""  The food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items, but I didn't find anything good. Everything seems to be made from ""freezer to fryer"" or packaged products. I'm not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs. In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devil's Advocate.  One of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. He'll ask patrons ""how is everything?"" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say. I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average, but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesn't matter.  In this city, sports bars are a dime a dozen. I'd rather go elsewhere."|0
omg...hands down the worst chinese food I've ever had anywhere.  Stopped by for lunch with my wife.  I ordered their cashew chicken dish and my wife ordered the pad thai noodles with shrimp.  Barely edible.  Makes Panda Express look like gourmet chinese food.  Prior to Flo's, the distinction of the worst chinese food went to a chinese restaurant in Nebraska...but that's Nebraska.  I'm chinese and live in San Francisco so know a thing or two about good chinese food.|0
I was accused of training my wife for compensation and was told to leave the gym or he (Page the trainer) was going to call the cops.  I don't know how a trainer confuses me working WITH my wife with training my wife for compensation.    Management handled this issue horribly.   Their lack of attention to the matter showed exactly what a customer of 6 years was worth.   You are treated only as a number.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.  I have since started going to a gym which is much more expensive but worth every penny to be treated with respect.|0
"When I was in highschool various clubs used to sell Karsh's bagels around campus to raise money. I would buy a bagel and cream cheese and hide it in my backpack to munch on during class. Soooo good!  I was feeling nostalgic one day and decided to pop in for a bagel and cream cheese.  The guy behind the counter was nice enough, I told him my order which came to $2.95 or something just barely under $3.  I had failed to notice the sign which said they do not accept credit cards for purchases under $3. I apologized and said I didn't have any cash and offered to run the the ATM.  The guy behind the counter very nicely asked other lady behind the counter  (the owner? manager on duty maybe?) if she would let me use my card. She looked right at me all stink-eyed and said ""No"" and returned to what she was doing. No apology, no ""I'm sorry but there is an ATM at so and so...."" Very curt.  Thanks a lot personality plus! I will not be returning and I hope you choke on a matzo ball.  Shame too, I loved those bagels."|0
"Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit? I should have known the second I realized that Bliss/reBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.  And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. Um, it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess we'll wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. That's sure inviting, isn't it.  So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My ""veggie"" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was.   Eggplant.  Ohhhhkay then.   It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.  So, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA. You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours.   Just UGH in every way."|0
I love Saddle Ranch for its casual night time festivities (including watching people ride the mechanical bull hehehe), but I cannot ignore the fact that the food was disgusting!  When I think of my meal this past Friday night, I think of two words: dry and cold. The spinach artichoke dip was just okay - a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy. The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonald's, maybe even worse. The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was dry and tasteless as was the bacon. Really? It must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless. There are a few things that the menu has going for itself - a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere. I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and, though I'm not much of a beer drinker, the beer tower looks pretty badass.  For me, I came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere, but I will definitely be staying away from the grub. Adios, cowboy.|0
Lazy Q CLOSED in 2010.  New Owners cleaned up the place and its called JESTERS BILLIARDS.  Tons of beer, AC smoking patio with pool tables.  Re-did tables and got new cues.  Its rockin now.|0
I haven't yelped in about 2 months, and I was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me.  Well, this place was that bad.   First impressions were all right -- the outside bar was neat w/ good views of downtown, and the fire pits were nice.  No beers on tap though; and seriously, what's with the hip-hop club DJ at 7:00 pm?  Come on guys, way too early for that.  It wasn't too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes, our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to ... oh wait, that's right, no menus yet, good job.  O.k., so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls, which had a filling of lettuce, a single strip of carrot, and noodles.  Seriously?!  Main course, I ordered the curry, which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- I don't even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick, yellow soup, with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in.  Yuck.  And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice.  I'm sorry, isn't it supposed to be the other way around?  My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry, which they said was bland and pointless).  So yeah, I don't recommend this place.  Instead, head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food.|0
"The food was decent, however I am writing about their underhanded business practices. I ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals. It said ""Regularly $140"". What we ordered, if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100. However, we were charged tax on the full $140.   Second, even though on the voucher it says ""PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK."" (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity, 18% gratuity (18% of $140, even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check.  Third, even if you had ordered the most expensive options, the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120, not $140. It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value, but that is what they add tax and tip to.  Fourth, after we told our waiter we were using a voucher, he seemed less interested in the service level of our table, which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18% (of $140) tip.  I just noticed today they have another travelzoo deal ""$79 - AWARD-WINNING FRENCH DINNER FOR 2 W/WINE, REG. $165"", I am posting this so hopefully if anyone is thinking of buying that voucher, they will read this first before they purchase it."|0
"I was so, so hopeful.  October in Scottsdale, yummy, tacos.....Wow!  Rip Off!! $10 Just to get in (what was that for?). No shade unless you were buying a drink.  Most places wouldn't give you salsa or taco sauce with your measly over priced taco. They seemed like the vultures who didn't care about the customer, just the $2 ticket they could grab from you.   I had to beg for a napkin then hunt for a place to sit feeling watched by the other vultures waiting for me to get up. I was ready to leave after 45 minutes and my Pepsi had gotten warm, so I had gotten a cup of ice from the bar.   I poured it in, took one drink and as I was leaving to hike back to my car, security stopped me and would n't let me take it out! ""It could have booze in it"".  Well, by then, I was one angry little local. Dumped it all in trash and said to my sweet daughter in law who was about to ""go mad"" with me, ""Get me outta here!"". She had brought her 2 year old, thinking what a fun way to spend a Saturday morning and encourage our local businesses.  Nope.  Not good."|0
After reading all the good reviews, we were looking forward to eating here, but we were a bit apprehensive due to the couple of bad reviews because of the smell. Bummer...the smell just killed it for us right from the get go. Immediately, upon walking in the door, the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a ton-of-bricks. We did a 180 and walked right out. No way I could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk.   Get the smell worked out and we will give you another shot, Tasty Thai.|0
"Walk the other way, just walk right the hell the other way...  Here was how this played out.  Oktoberfest a few days ago.  Starting the night off.  I walk past this place and see a place that sells a slice of pizza for $1.99.  Good, right?  No.    me: ""Hi, one slice of pizza please"" guy: ""you buy drink with it, 4 dollars."" me: ""no, just one slice of pizza"" guy: ""we do not sell one slice, you have to buy a drink.  4 dollars""  I should have pulled a flag on this play at this point, but knowing I was going to be drinking I move forward wanting food in me. Not a wise move.  me: ""so, I can't buy one slice?"" guy: ""no, you buy a drink with slice, 4 dollars."" me: ""It doesn't say that anywhere on the menu or walls"" guy: ""No, do not sell one slice. me: ""what the... O.K., give me 2 slices of pizza"" guy: ""you buy two slices then."" me: ""yes, Jesus Christ, yes"" guy: ""toppings?"" me: ""no, no toppings.  cheese."" guy: ""we have toppings.""  what is this guy, fucking deaf?   me: ""no thanks""  I give him the money.  guy: ""it take 10 minutes, you wait.""  I don't think they run the air conditioner in this place, so I wait outside.  Pizza comes out.  Tastes like absolute crap.  I eat it outside because in September in Chandler Arizona it is cooler outside then inside this place.  I think they had the thermostat set to ""HELL"" Guy working or running the place comes outside and stares me down as I am eating.  I'm sure if you want to eat here you can check the dumpster for plenty of slices to try beforehand to avoid having to pay for one.  Excuse me, avoid having to pay for two.  However after what I had served to me I'm pretty sure they will beat you to the garbage cans and sell it back to some other unsuspecting soul.  I was the only one dumb enough to finish all the food.  Wouldn't eat here if there was a natural disaster and this place was the last to be ransacked for provisions.  I'd keep walking.  FAIL."|0
I was not impressed. The food was bad & expensive. The wait is ridiculous. Don't go.|0
Our bartender was rude and impersonal, to start. When my wife ordered a diet coke, you could see her disdain. We saw her once more, when she took our food order, after which she sat in the corner and ate. The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word, and never came back; in fact, I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out. The food was sub par. My wife's Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes, and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side. Also, my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce.   Poor food, awful service, overpriced beer. Visit the Kyrene location or don't go at all.|0
The food was not particularly good on our last visit there and the service was rude and not helpful at all.  I even emailed them afterwards to give feedback, in hopes that they would redeem themselves by showing some good service that way.  No luck.  Didn't even get a response.  They will not be getting any more of my business.  Too bad because I'd actually had a decent mushroom burger there before and would have been a regular customer.  But the service last time was so bad that I won't go back.|0
"I don't think anyone who gave over a 2 has ever eaten Italian food in Chicago.   I struggled to give 2 stars, but figured the wings were decent .  #1) No celery salt on the Dog #2) No cucumber on the Dog #3) WORST OF ALL the GYRO, was not off a spit it was processed #4) Also, living 30 years in Chicago I have never had a gyro covered in more lettuce than there were onioins.  #5) Since when does a Gyro (not in Chicago) have Feta Cheese & almost not Tatziki #6) The PIZZA IS NOT CHICAGO STYLE ITS 100% New York #7) Wings are a 6 out of 10 #8) THERE IS NO DEEP DISH PIZZA OFFERED OR THICK CRUST??? #9) I apologize they have now gone from 2 to 1 star...   PLEASE CHANGE YOUR NAME YOU""RE A DISGRACE TO CHICAGO!!!  Don't think I will give this place another shot no reason"|0
Wow... After eating sushi from across the nation i have to say Scottsdale's Geisha A Go Go has surprised me for an ultimate low. Andrew, the manager, reassured us that we had something wrong with our taste buds for not tasting how fresh the fish was here. Insulting to assume. Not recommended!!!!|0
"We were excited to check out this new restaurant! We were left extremely underwhelmed. We sat in the bar to watch MNF. It would have been nice to be able to hear the game over the discordant pop rock music at a mexican establishment but I understand that you are not a ""sports bar"". It was Monday night and with the exception of a large group  of blue hairs celebrating secretary's day the place was empty.  The bar area managed to fill up, because the Cardinals were on tv and it seemed as thought the high tops and patio were busy as well.   Our bartender Amanda was very polite and eager to up sell us their flavored tequilas and specialty cocktails. You can tell she was a little wet behind the ears but she was doing her best nothing a little training and experience can't fix. The wait time to receive a cocktail was excruciatingly long though being a former bartender I understand the complexity that new bars go though to develop new and unique cocktails.  We ordered the pumpkin margarita. I applaud the attempt but personally it tasted like puréed baby food.   I was feeling very open minded and wanted to experience as much as I could that TQLA had to offer so we ordered the salsa trio and chicken tortilla soup.    Queso dip: cold Habanero dip: sweet with a swift kick afterwards: not bad Guacamole: good: but was gone after 2 bites. I guess they feel if they place the guacamole on a bed of green shredded lettuce it will look like there is more than delivered. Fail  Chicken tortilla soup: Thick tomato soup with dry dark meat chicken chunks. Maybe it is just me but I prefer a more broth based ck tort soup and juicy white/dark meat chicken. Bleh: Amanda offered to remove it off our bill but I insisted on finishing mine because I was hungry. My GF pushed hers to the side; DNF.   Meanwhile; whilst experience our starters we managed without any silverware or napkins and at this point Amanda being the only bartender on managed to become flooded with specialty cocktails in the well; thus not being able to properly oversee her patrons at the bar. Needles to say our drinks were empty, our plates, monkey dishes, empty bowl of chips, 2 cups of bland tortilla soup, saucers and wrinkled up black beverage napkins (used in the place of the real ones) were all tattering on the edge of the bar eagerly anticipating a bus boy to remove them.   Onto the Entrees:  I ordered the carne Asada steak.  My girlfriend tried the habanero chicken platter. They were delivered by TQLA manager ""Joe"". Whom decidedly pulled himself from enjoying the football game to expedite some food. He crept up behind us and shuffled the entree platters in front of our faces after we spread our dirty dishes closer to the edge of the bar and politely stacked them for our ficticious busboy/girl to remove them properly. Now in my history with management; a decent manager would offer to remove the collection of dishes but instead he decided to ask us if we needed anything else since the look on our faces was disgust. Instead we opted to inform Joe that we would enjoy our meal a little better with silverware and napkins.  He acknowledged that was a novel concept and proceeded to fetch us a pair. Joe wasn't six steps away before he was interrupted by a member of the waitstaff who informed him that what she needed was more important than delivering two setups to some first time customers so they could enjoy their ever increasingly cold food.  At this point my girlfriends temper got the best of her and she jumped up and retrieved her own silverware off of a table in front of Joe and eager waitress to salvage any heat that might have been left in our entrees.   We dig in:    Carne Asada: was tender but lacking the Wow factor.   Habanero Chicken: Tasted like a chicken breast smothered in their warm fire roasted salsa... What happened to the habaneros?  Where is the heat...? Bland  I hope they get better: but until then Nandos all the way. Never saw Joe touch any tables, never offered to help out a bartender who was swimming laps in an Olympic size pool. Occasionally the wait staff would come behind the bar and help out.  This is about the time that our appetizers, chips, soups, and entrees were all removed from the bartop. FYI Joe, the hostess stand can hold itself up on its own. You don't have to stand there and hold it up. Keep an eye on your staff and customers and offer help where they need it so people will be happy to come back and give you a second shot."|0
Love the idea - vegan Mexican. Have tried to eat there twice. Both times checked their FB page for hours, both times they were closed. Called their phone number, no one answered. No sign, no explanation on FB. Pathetic.|0
"It was family day (the ex and I like to see our son smile) and we were starving... after driving around for a while we pulled up to Arriba's and said ""what the hell...""  That's also what we said when some of the food came, as in ""what the hell is this??""  So positive first.  The server was pretty quick and he gave refills without being asked.  Chips and salsa were good.  Chips were warm and salsa had a nice (suprising) kick.  Kick... do I sound like an old lady?   Morgan and I ordered fish tacos and beef tacos, respectively, so we could swap one for one.  Fish was ok... nothing spectacular... but honestly I would rather pay for one at freakin Del Taco or Rubios.  Not worth it here.  Rice was ok, some flavor, probably converted rice though.  Beans were... blended?  I dunno about you but I like to see some actual BEANS in my beans!  This stuff was like brown goo... YUMMMMMMMM... :P  The beef taco was just weird.  I swear to God is tasted like gyro meat!  WTF?  I couldn't eat much of it.    Last but not least, Dom ordered the White Sands Chimichanga.  That sh*t looked nasty to be honest.  Covered with some gooey white sauce, filled with pork.  LOL, he said it tasted like hot dog.  Um, yikes!  He took about 2 bites and was ""full"".  A.K.A., he didn't like it.  I also had a margarita... it was HUGE and didn't taste very good.  I'd rather have one 1/4 that size that tasted nice.  Oh well.  One star for the chips and salsa.  Like I said, the fish taco was okay, but every thing was just way over-priced!    Final verdict?  We decided to NEVER go there again."|0
"Ok, im not getting the great reviews on this place. I FINALLY made it Lamar's before they closed for the day and tried a couple donuts. I have a few problems here. The big one, can we please list that ""only the donuts with holes"" are $5.49 for 6? Its a bit deceptive to just list the price of 6 and ring up the donuts and have them turn out to be well over $7. Makes me want to buy my donuts from someone else.     Second, these donuts are WAY over priced and they are average at best. The maple bar tastes like you are eating spoon fulls of sugar they are so sweet. And the rest of the donuts I tried were pretty stale. This will be the first and last time I will be going to Lamar's. Give me Krispy Kreme or anyone else for that matter. Thank god for Lamar's we dont have Spudnuts in the valley because they would be out of business."|0
My boyfriend and I tried this place last year and we haven't been back since. The food was really unspectacular, they weren't really that hot. The price is a bit high since there's a restaurant by the same name on Southern and Dobson that serve much better food for less. The decor was really tacky and they should paint over the mural, it does not appeal to their clientele. Lastly, the staff was not nice.|0
"If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.  But, I'm not  rating it based on the food.  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but won't split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote ""family style"".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served ""family style"" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was ""this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties"".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It would've taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.  Worst experience ever!"|0
"This was the most HORRIBLE floor cleaning I have ever seen!!!!! We took before and after pictures and cannot tell the difference at all! The guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job! I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. We paid $1000 and got $20 worth of service. I mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the ""staining as he would say"" off easily. I have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaning....can you read the saying? That is exctaly how we felt after the service. REALLY?!?!?"|0
Wednesday 7pm.  This place is your average over priced, lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different.   I have to say, I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews, now I'm starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food.  Service=slow. Food=just tastes like salt Noise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot.  Go somewhere else and skip Joe's Crabs.|0
Refused to call me a cab because I had a phone.|0
The cheesy breadsticks were delicious.  Everything else, not so much.|0
Wow?!  Is this the new Barcelona?!  Yuck!  Old scuzy men and middle aged women with fake boobs that are falling out of their painted on dresses.  All bars were completely under staffed on a Friday night.  We waited 7 minutes at the front bar until being ignored continuously and we became so frustrated that we made our way to the round bar and it seemed just as understaffed.  What's the point of only having a few bartenders on probably the busiest night of the week for bar-goers?  We even approached the blond manager to ask for service and she was completely rude and had a total lack of desire to help us.  We will NOT return due to the lack of service and efficiency.  This place has GOT to staff more bartenders and needs much more help.  Welcome to North Scottsdale Barcelona.|0
I'll be charitable - this place sucks!  I went there because a friend had *exactly* the piece of furniture I needed and he got his from Ikea.   After wandering around the store forever, I finally found the right department.  The people working there were cold. uncaring. not helpful. no concept of customer service.  I left in disgust!  Couple of days later, I was in Cost Plus World Market @ 18th St. & Camelback.  Voila!  I fould what I wanted - for close to the same price.  the BIG difference:  Warm smiles, friendly people, volunteered to go out of their way to help me.  Felt like I was among long-time friends!  They even delivered when they said they would.  And, no need to drive half way to tucson and back!  Ikea?  Don't be foolish.  Cost Plus?  Now, there's a place that earned my repeat business!|0
Bad music, slow service, disgusting overpriced drinks, and annoying patrons.  Definitely wouldn't come back if someone paid me to. I can't even drink this margarita.|0
There was hair in the food. Not just 1 but 2 in the same Bhel Puri dish.  The whole experience was pretty bad. There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good. We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case.  Also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive.  Pani Puri was OK Papdi Chaat - boring, no flavor Bhel Puri - boring and no flavor before we found the hairs  Not worth the trip.|0
I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this place.|0
I went here while on vacation visiting my friend. Neither of us had been there before, but I know they have lots of locations on the west coast, so we gave it a try.   The staff was totally rude. Before we went, we called to check the hours. The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information.   The pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special. If you're going to have mediocre food, you better have exceptional service. Double fail.|0
We bought or second Jura Compressa coffee machine from Sur La Table.  It was an expensive model priced over $3K.  After 2.5 short months it stopped working.  The only  option they offered was to send it in for repair.  When I asked to have it replaced I was told the turn around was 48 hours.  Its actually 4 -5 weeks when all is said and done.  I high priced item and thats the kind of customer service. Not to mention an expensive product that cant make it 90 days.  Extremely bad customer service on this one.|0
Let me first say that we are fans of the W Hotel and have stayed in many of their hotels around the nation and are overall happy with the accommodations and customer service.    I'm a local Phoenician who resides in the Arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this City has to offer.  After hearing MANY negative reviews from co-workers, family, and friends, my fiancé and I decided to give the W Hotel Scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotel/restaurant/bar.  During a night out on the town with visiting and local friends, we opted to give this place a try.  Upon approaching the entrance of the bar, security tells us that we're not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt.  The attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant/bar.  Let me remind you that's is July in Phoenix, and over one-hundred degrees at the time of night we went to the W and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent, popular restaurant.  The staff was flat out rude to not only us, but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel.  I will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here.  During a time of a slowing economy and tourism, many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain business--the W Hotel fell way short of this.  I was very discouraged after our experience here and will agree with the many other reviewers that this place in not worth supporting.    Phoenix/Scottsdale has many great places to experience, so don't settle for this place.|0
"I went in once looking for Canidae.  Which according to their website bold print they carry, but not the fine print.  They don't carry it in all of their stores.  My dog has food allergies so I'm cautious about changing her food quickly but since it was about 7 pm and I was pretty much out of food on this day, I figured some food would be better than no food.    During my visit I learned many things.  Apparently Canidae is a inferior brand and ripped off its ingredients and packaging from Innova.  Innova is a far, far superior dog food.  Innova is awesome, Canidae is for chumps.  Innova is also more expensive and a smaller bag.  Nothing I couldn't afford but annoying none the less. Not wanting to create dog food controversy I bought a bag of the morally superior Innova.  But when I checked out I was asked about four times whether I realized I was buying nibbles instead of bits.  ""You know you have the nibbles. Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if your dog prefers bits"".  She's a 70-lb lab that will eat anything except for vegetables.  I mentioned that the nibbles were fine.  ""Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if you want bits""?  Dude, just ring up the freaking food and get me the hell out of here.  As expected, my dog ate the nibbles.  She felt superior for the month supply of Innova that she ate.  Then she went back to the ghetto and ate her  inferior Canidae."|0
I usually do not write reviews, but was so horrified by my experience I had to. Went for a late night bite and drink with a friend, they were fairly busy so we had a seat at the bar. As I frequent The Moon often, I was happy to see the bar was busy as well. The bartender quickly came over and was noticably intoxicated, as she could not even tell me the flavors of vodka they had. We ordered our drinks, and watched as she broke glass into the ice, knocked over glassware and broke a beer bottle. As we looked around most of the guests had the same look of horror on their face. We decided to order some food, as she spilled my drink on us (refilled it with something completely different) and she could barely even talk at this point. We saw management watch her behavior and do nothing, as she preceded to grab dirty glassware and refill it with beer. I was so appauled by this we left befpre finishing our drinks or food. I'm not sure what she was on but if its visible to paying customers it should be visible to management. Being beyond embarassed for the establishment, I would doubt I will come back, sad as we would frequent the Moon 2-3 times a week. Horrible.|0
"I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 21 location.  She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.  She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.  Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted. They did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences.  They just shrugged their shoulders.  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.  There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were ""socializing"" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion. The only employees that were on task were:  1 at the checkout, and 1 at the fitting rooms - there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos (including someone stealing bags from other customers)..... So - if you choose to shop at this store - hold on to your bags :)"|0
"Sadly disappointed.  I've passed Lola's an uncountable number of times and each time thought I needed to try it.  I finally did tonight and was terribly disappointed.  For anyone that has been to Firefly in Las Vegas there is just no comparison.  The sangria was decent but nothing special and the tapas were just ""so so.""  The atmosphere was busy and our service sucked, but it was a very unique and cool environment."|0
Overcrowded, sprawling mess of a mall (and I normally like malls). Traffic and parking are almost as bad as at Tempe Marketplace. The confusing layout makes it hard to find specific stores (even with the help of the directories).|0
I'm sorry. You're too busy to look up my club card information? Too busy too push the button to do the search, enter my phone number and click ok?  I took the time once upon whenever to sign up for your card. And now, you can't take 5 seconds to look it up for me? Let me clue you in, the cashiers here have always looked it up. It always takes 5-10 seconds at most! Great customer service. Insert sarcasm here for the uneducated.  Other Big Lots this hasn't been a problem. Just the one.|0
"I signed up for Yelp just because of the poor service and being cheated out of money from Cafe Rio. I already voiced my complaint to the restaurant and to their website in writing, however I haven't received a phone call or email back.  I've visited this establishment twice and each time I go I receive very little toppings on my burrito or tacos. I understand that it's made to your order like Chiptole or Qdoba, but they'll add very little cheese or toppings on your food, which can cause you to request more. To save myself time and every yelpers eyes from reading this long story, the individual making my tacos was extremely frugal on the toppings on my tacos. She barely put any cheese on my 3 tacos and I simply requested that she could put a little more on the tacos. She did and when I went to pay for my order, I was charged an extra 95 cents for ""side cheese."" The issue isn't the money because eating at Cafe Rio can be expensive for a fast-food mexican restauant, but it's the principle of charging me extra after I said, ""can you please put a little more cheese on my taco.""   This hasn't been the first time this happened, but a previous visit had the same result with the sauce on my burrito. I thought mexican food restaurants had gigantic burritos and generous size tacos, but Cafe Rio will charge you on top of your order if you don't like their skinny tacos.  All I ask for from Cafe Rio to acknowledge that when you add more toppings to what the cook's add to your food, that they say, ""this will be extra."" They do this at Chiptole and Qdoba, but Cafe Rio would rather screw you over at the end.   I will not be visiting this establishment again. As I said, it's the principle as to why they charged me extra for this, not the money."|0
food is ok, but service is very slow!|0
I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews. The service is good. We didn't have to wait but I didn't like the food I ordered. I had a salmon with caper butter sauce. The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me.|0
I'm sorry to be what seems to be the lone one star review.  Either I got there on the worst day in their history, or everyone drank the Koolaid, or I just have different expectations and taste buds. It seems like a great idea.  It's a build your own burger joint, $7.00 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese, up to 4 toppings, and 2 sauces with fries or onion rings-or some other choices.  They also claim that the beef is local, hormone free, etcetera....  I chose a rare burger with American, grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms. tomato and lettuce, with mayo and mustard on a potato bun.  I added bacon for a dollar.  First, let me point out that if you are in a hurry, DON'T GO HERE TO EAT.  I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food. This would not be a big deal if: 1.  I had been warned before they ran my credit card--what if I only had 30 minutes for lunch?? 2. They had places to sit but it's tiny and full. 3.  They had magazines, a jukebox, ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes.  You can't even get your drink early to sip on that.  At the 30 minute mark, I'm ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it, so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better? Anyway, before my burger comes up, I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen.  I look in the kitchen---they have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS??????   He'd better be getting a share of the profits!!!!!  Now I'm jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there.  I finally get my burger!  YAY!!  I'm SO excited!  All those 4 and 5 star reviews!  I take a bite and....the patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon. WTH?  I look at the patty.  It's clean as a whistle. I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty.  I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket.  The other side is clean too.  The freakin' burger was so greasy, it slid all over the place!  Then a greasy glop of what must have  been the mushrooms and onions slid out.  Still not seeing any cheese, mayo, or mustard anywhere.  Just oil.  Tons and tons of oil.  I open the bun,  On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by (I am guessing) a slice of cheese.  The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residue--and more oil.  I'm grossed out, but hungry.  I take a bite.  It's not rare,  It's well done and oddly, tastes very faintly of liver.  BTW, remember the bacon I paid a dollar for?  Not there.  I'm really puzzled that instead of cheese. or beef, or SOMETHING, I just taste that faint livery taste. So I take another bite.There isn't even any salt or pepper, or anything on the burger patty.  This is perhaps, the worst grade of meat available for human consumption.  I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town.  Now I recognize the flavor.  I'm not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow, but that's EXACTLY what it tasted like.  At this point, I turn to the fries.  The are shriveled and DARK and taste like they've been fried and then microwaved.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough!  Forget my danged dollar!  just get me in the car!  Exactly one hour and 20 minutes later, I had vicious diarrhea  I haven't had that trouble even with eating junk food at the fair!  No.  NO.  A thousand times NO!  Red Robin is my next burger stop.

I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation. I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.  However, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)  So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.  When my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.  The waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.  As a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.  A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible.  The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.  I do not intend to go back.|0
Long wait for food, waitresses that don't know what they're doing, grumpy hosts, and crappy food that keeps us off the lake for 2 hours is not somewhere I plan on going ever again.|0
I am totally baffled why this place gets such good reviews. I have been there a few times because it's close to my work and I received some gift certificates for my birthday. Unfortunately after the last experience, I can't go back.  Although they are very nice and have great prices, I have to reveal the ugly truth:  1. They don't put any effort into sanitizing the tools or the pedicure bowl. I actually saw them clean the brushes and tools in the water I was soaking my feet in and then just rinse out the bowl after they were done... not spray, soap, nothing! 2. Reason #1 probably explains why my heals cracked so severely after my pedicure that they began to bleed.  I had to use peroxide, neosprin, and bandages for almost a week to get it heal.  3. They water down their nail polish... so much that it destroys the bond and polish never actually dries.  I hate to bash a business with good customer service, but these practices are simply unacceptable.  I obviously won't be back. =(|0
What a load of absolutely hideous, uninteresting crap.  Take every single one-star review written by Yelpers below, copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything I can come up with.  I have no reason to ever come here. Certainly not free will. The one time I did come here I was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend.|0
The theater itself I have no problem with. Its the fact that we came out of the theater to a broken out driver passenger window, my doors unlocked and some Dumb Ass broke into my car and didn't even take anything. Really??  I should've known better given the area but it was the only Harkins showing the movie we wanted to see. Security was nice enough to leave a note on my window.Can you believe there's No Cameras in the parking lot at all!! Ugh!!! Disappointed customer to say the least. Will not be back there that's for sure.|0
Let me first say if I could have given 0 stars I would have.  My wife and I went to this place and were EXTREMELY disappointed. We had gone to a different Pancho's many years ago and were hoping it would be like that. The choices were very very limited and basic. There are so many amazing Mexican dishes yet my only choices were a tamale,taco and some horrible tasting enchiladas. How does a Mexican food place not offer burritos...have you guys heard of a bean burrito? Its pretty popular and would be a good choice to offer.  The only food here that is worth eating is the baby churros and the Sopapillas, which actually were good. Unfortunately I didn't go to this place to pay $20 so my wife and I can eat Sopapillas.   Please listen to my advice when I tell you to avoid this place. Take your money to taco bell and get a lot better Mexican food at a fraction of the cost.|0
D-scust-ing.|0
PIECE OF **** manager wouldn't put air conditioning on yesterday. It was 90. They just lost alot of business.|0
We've eaten here a few times, and the food was always good.  However, the last time we ate there, I found a BUG in my food.  When we complained to management, they still thought we should pay for 50% of the meal.  Never eating there again.|0
Another night meeting friends here.  I have to laugh.  Waited another 20 minutes for my beer to be refilled at the bar.  A girl even took my empty without even asking if I wanted a refill.  A new brunette girl that I don't recognize left the bar and sat down with her guy friends on the customer side AT 9:25 ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.  Another bartender had to ask her to come back and work.  Management....  Pull your head out of your ass!  Sad to watch....  I need to talk my friends into another place!|0
I really hate to do this.  This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food.  The buffet was pathetic and contained maybe 12 items (no white rice).  My sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre.  China Garden has, hands down, the worst eggroll I've eaten.  Given the atmosphere of the place it was plain to see China Garden had regulars.  One guy at the cashier even commented that he'd been coming since 1970.  I don't get it.  This is the worst restaurant I have ever dined at.  The staff and whom I presumed to be the owner/manager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food.|0
Lets just say i was not to please with my experience at Nails R Us. After two days my nails were lifting on about 4 nails by the end of the weekend i had 6 nails lifting, so i went back and showed them and she was like its normal. No it normal to lift but not after 2 days! They did fix them for me free of charge but were very rude to me!!! Will not be going back there or will not refer any of my friends there!|0
I had such a nice experience here - Classic Chicken - the first time that I really wanted to go back. Second time, onion strings were so greasy I couldn't eat them, burger was okay. Third time, yesterday? Enough to say we wont go back. Ever.   Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth, he ordered 1/3 lb classic, me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda. Soda was disgusting, flat, watery, gross. Upon the lovely's complaint, the bus boy brought him bottled water. I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair. Gak. We got up and left our food. Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda, we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we 'didn't have a better experience'. Um. A better experience??? Seriously? 15 dollars?   Ugh.|0
"Ugh!!    A 25 min wait greeted us before anyone recognized our presence.  We were offered complientary champaigne in consideration.  Who drinks champainge??  We were allowed to order wine prior to hearing of the chef's feast, which offers a wine pairing.  That's dumb.  We ordered a meat/cheese plate.  It contained head cheese.  Hmmmm.  Overpriced and oversalted.  30 min later our salads came.  The salads were ok and unfortunately the highlight of the meal.  35 min later our main course came.  Overcooked, uneventful, lame.  I can't drink alcohol and ordered water.  Twice I was left w/ no water for extended periods.  Both times I was foced to ask for water.  There were no hand towels in the unisex bathroom.  It's no fun to dry your hands using toilet paper.  The ""best"" part was saved for last.  Quiessence automatically adds an 18% gratuity, which is OK assuming the service is at least adequate.  It wasn't.  Further, as our waiter dropped the bill, he explained the 18% ""goes to the house"" and anything additional we might addd, though not required, is most appreciated.  Egad....why does the house need a service charge w/ the magnificent margins they charge for their normal food service?  And why do they put their staff in the position of shaking down their patrons for tips?  Although it's a very nice, calming setting, I found myself wanting to leave after the first appy.  Food, service and ancillary were simply terrible.  Stay away.  You'll spend your $175 for 2 much better most anywhere else."|0
"Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll. This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong.  You've been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neiman's on a worthless Jhane Barnes' sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-season's-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, you're toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi.  It's OK, but beware. Unagi and other ""hot"" items have a ""beep-beep beep-beep"" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- 'cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup.  If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol' times' sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant.  And about the Brioni... Don't sweat the buyer's remorse. It'll make a great tax deduction to Florence's."|0
This dog park gets one star.Why?Because the last time I went,some piece of shit broke into just about every car in the parking lot to steal whatever they could.So much broken glass from side windows everywhere. It used to be okay before this incident,but a busy parking lot in borad daylight and some vulture lies in wait? Yeah,I'm done here.|0
Maybe I should have had a hot dog but I crave Chicago's Italian beef,  I didn't get it here just some greasy old beef of some kind,  use beef broth if the meat gets dry, not a whole can of olive oil,  YUK!  It didn't have that good Italian beef flavor so I asked for giardinara to add some flavor,  it was very oily too and I had to pay extra for any peppers either hot or mild. No stars for that beef,  the only saving grace was it didn't make me too sick,  I expected to be sick for days not just one day!|0
"It is what you would expect from any themed place called ""Heart Attack Grill"".  Mirrors on the bottom part of the bar so you can see up the skimpy outfits the ""nurses"" wear at the bar.  Van in the drive through section is painted to look like an Ambulance.  Hamburgers are named after cardiac events.  The food was bad, greasy unlimited fries and a giant hamburger that tasted as if they mixed in filler of some kind we had never experienced before.  If you plan on going, enjoy the experience cause the food will not be something you would head back for again."|0
RUDE RUDE RUDE I wanted to book a diner for my wife and I ( our anniversary. . The website i was on did not post the times of operation.  I left a message and today got a call back from a RUDE Owner.  He argues it is right there. He did not ask anything about where i was o tried to help . He called to argue  with me.   I can not believe i get a call at work and then when i tell the reason of the issue he argues with me and hangs up... childish behavior . I read the reviews on DEX and other sites and found that this is true across the board. Poor food prep and pretentious environment and owners... good bye Lon's  chief - ill never go to your location now.  And my 12,000 Sedona list will  be aware of your bad manners.  I am a native to Scottsdale and Lon's was a place that we went to almost 6 times a year. It was my mother's favorite place to eat. - until the food started going down hill. I believe it was these people who were at the helm at that time. I heard they were asked to leave.  Hanging up on people.... this is incredible...   DO NOT GO HERE!!|0
"Qver-priced, substandard food.  Never met a cheeseburger I didn't like-- until now, (NOT a 1/2 lb.).   Small portions of tired, room temperature ""fry-pieces"",  burnt bacon, chicken tenders so hard, they couldn't be penetrated with a fork.  Mediocre service;  didn't bring kids meal cookie.  Waste of $$$!"|0
"I live down the street from Casey Moore's. I have been here a total of three times. The first time a group of us just ordered drinks, and the margaritas my friend and I ordered were so terrible that we sent them back. The second time I went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich. Again, it was so awful I had to send it back. I am not a picky eater, nor have I been known to complain about food or service when dining out. There has only been one other restaurant I have ever been to where I sent food back. So, this place was already two for two. Alas, my husband begged me to go back once more. He was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give them one more shot. It was last Thursday evening, and the place was hoppin'. This time, the food was decent. Not good, but decent enough where I may have given Casey Moore's a fourth chance had I been impressed with the service. But the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress got us our drinks and didn't come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes. We sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by, and though she passed us quickly several times, she never even acknowledged us with a simple ""I'll be back with your orders."" When she did arrive 20 minutes later, she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology. I am not kidding you when I say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us. She was very monotone and never smiled with us. I would like to pass this off as her having a bad night, but when she went to her other tables (all full of men with drinks) she suddenly lit up, laughed, and had a blast with them. It was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past. But no. This was our first time meeting her. We were pleasant customers who didn't complain about the mediocre food or slow service. We were polite and left a good tip. We pride ourselves on being fun, engaging, and polite with our servers since we go out often. But let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry. We live so damn close to this place and would have loved to be regulars... It is such a shame that Casey Moore's has now given us three good reasons to never come back. And I can't find any information on their website of how to contact the manager about this, so I am left to rant here on Yelp, completely unsatisfied. Sigh..."|0
"Great donuts but horrible service... Didn't get anything we wanted due to a language barrier between us and the limited English speaking employee. She claimed, in broken English, to only speak Spanish. She understood ONLY the word ""dozen"" and we got a dozen of what ever she felt like giving us, then proceeded to ignore us while using her cell phone! Donut shops are a dime a dozen and we will never again return to Bosa."|0
I have received two pedicures and a manicure from this location.  I usually prefer a more spa like experience but the cost is low and I was attempting to save a few dollars.  Cutting cost may not be a good thing to do when it comes to body care.  I won't be returning because I am concerned about health violations.  Pros: Quick service Cheaper than the spa, salon  Cons: Improper cleaning of foot baths.  I thought they were good until I saw them seat a women at a used station.  They only took the sprayer and rinsed the dirty bowl.  (I did let her know)  The foot massage was more like a foot beating.  About an hour later my ankles felt like I had rolled them.  It took almost two weeks for them to feel normal again.  The sent in the shop is of fake nails.  If everyone has on a mask, I would like one to.|0
"I don't intend to return, but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week, my ""uncouth"" self doesn't exactly feel welcome anyway. However, I'm not quite convinced that it's my loss...   It had been almost a year since my original visit to Breadfruit which did not overwhelm (as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back) but I did have an appreciation of the option for Caribbean cuisine.   Since a friend and I were going to be downtown for an event, I suggested Breadfruit for our dinner spot. We enjoy good food and supporting local. The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat!   While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book. We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad ($9.95) and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill ($14.95).   Here's the ultimate rub, the bottom of the menu states ""no substitutions or modifications""... Since when is cutting a KFC-side-sized ear of corn a ""modification""?   At the same time, the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as ""Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body.""   It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it -- particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it's ""beauty"" AND after we've communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items -- is in the vein of ""nothing fancy.""   How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves, then?   The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFC-side-sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams ""pretentious and grandiose"" and tainted our entire experience.   To quote my dinning companion, ""You are not James Beard and James Beard would've cut the corn!"""|0

"If you like sushi, go somewhere else. I was extremely disappointed in the quality of both the service and the food.   I decided to take my family here because the other reviews seemed good; however, either my experience was an anomaly or the other Phoenix yelpers and I have stark differences in taste.  The staff had great smiles, yet lacked follow through. We had to ask for water and extra ginger twice. The sushi rolls were the flimsiest I have ever seen! Although poor in quality, they were high in price for what they serve. I'm not sure about the names of some of their rolls...one was named ""Climax."" Gross and just distasteful.    The decor and ambiance leave you wanting. They have three different wallpapers hanging and the music is overwhelming.   Even though this is the only sushi bar in Surprise, I will gladly drive to Peoria or Scottsdale the next time I have a craving for sushi."|0
Just don't.|0
"This place is worse than the IRS, at least the IRS admits when they made a mistake. But these arrogant workers will be caught dead before they hear themselves say ""sorry for the inconvenience"" or ""we made a mistake"".  They gave me different information on two consecutive visits that I made, then Dorrie, some lady who obviously should not have been working that day because she was coughing phlegm all over my documents, then after she asked me to wait by the counter for 10 minutes while their system updated.   I waited, 1 hour and 30 minutes later I finally went to the information counter and asked for Dorrie... I was told that she had gone to lunch 15 minutes ago and was told to go talk to another lady. She just dismissed me and I went to go talk to the new lady, who was also extremely rude and kept rolling her eyes and interrupting me before I could finish my sentences.  Basically i spent total of 3 and a half hours waiting and getting attitude and nothing was resolved because of their mis information and Dorries idiot customer service ethics and the last ladys pride..  not one person resolved anything and they all were too proud to say ""we apologize for the inconvenice"".  I recommend this place if you wanna be late to work 2 or more hours and having your mild mannered patience tested to the maximum."|0
Just had Daphnes for the last time. In the 3 times that we have ordered from them, they cannot seem to get a simple order right. One Kids Burger with Apple Slices (Nope) one side of hummus(Nope) But they are quick to charge you for the order. Then you call and talk to a girl name Liz and she begins to tell you that they are correct and you the customer are wrong. Even though I have all the food sitting in front of me nope still no kids burger or side of hummus. HMMMMM,.. keep letting her answer the phone and you will see your to go customer base decline. We are an office in Scottsdale that everyday is ordering lunch for the office, Daphnes has officially been removed from the menu book.  Nice customer service!!!!!!|0
"DO NOT GO HERE.  One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.  The setup is a little like ""Pei Wei"" where they take your order, give you a number, and bring the food to your table.  Placed our order, and had to stalk other tables and hover over people eating trying to wait to get a table.  Waited a long time, all the while others who ordered after us found seats and got their food before us. Servers kept bringing my food to me since it was ready, but I still didn't have a table, so they kept saying they would ""put it under the heat lamp"" for me.  Finally eventually found a table, and then kept waiting and waiting for our food, which the manager claimed ""he had them remake"" since it was getting cold.  My food came, and it was cold and disgusting.  We had to get going since we were going to a show, and my mom's food still wasn't there.  The staff asked to see her receipt, since they couldn't find her order.  She went up to the manager and said she just wanted her money back since we had to go (it had been 45 minutes since we placed our order).  He said her food would not be ready for a while, and gave her some cash, and we left.  My mom never even ate, and my food was horrible.  I would NOT recommend this place, it's awful."|0
What's with the cheese?  It isn't even Velveta.  It's liquid cheese food and it belongs somewhere other than on my burger.  $5 burger and fries is a great deal IF -- IF -- it's a great deal.  This is just liquid cheese food on a hamburger patty.  McDonald's will do a burger and fries for $5 that's tastier than this dump.|0
not clean, worst gel manicure ever and ruined my nails--Jimmy finished it --his wife started it.  Nails sanded too thin and they talk to other people and look away while they'e filing, sanding and cutting.  They cut two times now into the side of my thumb nail, which causes it to catch and tear off the same day, or soon.  Their 10 or 12-yr old daughter brought the colors to pick (she is much too precocous to be customer focused--she's narcisstic and I want an adult waiting on me).  They have to open bottles to look at gel color--no samples.  Gel drying machine is sitting on a priority mail box on top of chair in customer wait area.   Pedicure okay.  Won't come back.  This place like many with Vietnamese want your money, they don't understand service (or cleanliness in this one) and why we really come to these places.  They also try and nickle and dime you on price, for instance give you a deal to take off gel from previous manicure, when you're getting a new gel manicure.  They want to use the dremel to sand your nails down to the quick.  How about healthy nails and return visit.  This place I'm surprised stays in business.  Sadly it's not in a category by itself although the others are cleaner.  Jimmy should stay away from nails and customers, and just keep quiet.  The girl might be cute to some customers but I am not coming to have a 12-year old wait on me.  No thank you.|0
I will never go back to this establishment because all of the bouncers and wait staff are unfriendly, unprofessional and disrespectful.|0
Went here one night with a group of friends. This place is pink, crowded, and really not that impressive. I ordered some sorbet and it was bland - that in itself is an accomplishment - bland sorbet.  The 50's style booth seats were very uncomfortable (maybe to discourage staying long?) and the tables were the wrong height for eating. I had to strain to get above face level of my food (and i'm a normal sized woman) It was also very very (very) loud in here.  I'll avoid going here again. The quality of the product was just too poor - I'd rather hit up a Whole Foods and get some good sorbet without the discomfort and echoing nosie.|0
This place is over priced and the service is horrible. I went there with my feiends and the server was very rude and degrading!|0
"First of all, if you go here, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check your bill when it comes!  honestly.  We went here 3 times.  all 3 times we were over charged....  either the menu's were out of date, or we were ""past happy hour time"" (BS)... oh and the other excuse... we just changed our menu.  blah blah blah  P  then they always have to ""get a manager"" to come to the table, which takes forever!  (I am sure they hope we leave)  PLUS! THE SERVICE SUCKS ASS!!!!  this is a definitely bait and switch!  1st time it happened we just dealt with it, and was like, whatever...  2nd time it happened, my daughter who just got back from deployment (Navy) wanted to do something special for us and took us all there.  My husband looked at the check and noticed it wasy CRAZY over what we thought as we were there for happy hour.  The waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes, (gimme a break)  finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of 'arguing about it.  We discussed it about 20 minutes and we were finally like, whatever...  3rd time...  took a friend there.  again we ordered devils ale.  on the menu it was listed at one price... when we got the bill, it was almost twice as much.  We waited for our server to come back, she never did, she totally ignored us.  I gave her a dollar tip (which is NOT like me, i tip very well, too well)  and I wrote on the recept why she got such little money as a tip.    If you are looking for a fun time go caddy corner to San Filepe's  that place is fun and the staff are friendly and fun.  We much prefer there, we wll never go to Caddilac Ranch again.  They say 3rd time is a charm, Well, it is... its a charm to know you are overspending and its a big gimmick and they dont give a crap!  oh and if i didn't have to give a star, i wouldn't have."|0
I took my family here and this was a disappointin experience. The service was snobby and rude.  The waitress was condescending and the food was overprices. I have not been to the other Tomasos but I will clearly discourage anyone from dining at the Chandler Tomasos. The service is clearly substandard and snobby.|0
The portions are too small, the plasticware just reminds me of Jack In The Box, the serving tray is right from a mall food court, and the menu selection is drastically reduced.  You can't really enjoy conversation or relax at lunch listening to the kitchen scream out order numbers to the customers.  The flavor mixing softdrink machine is fun, but gimmicky.  The food quality and flavor are the same for the most part, but you do leave wanting more...  I won't be returning to this location.|0
Groupon rip-off. Small salad, three extremely small plates of mediocre pasta desserts that cloyed the palate. All for an advertised value of $90. Will NEVER return.|0
I had such high expectaions after reading reviews but I was so disappointed.  The food was not good, the service was awful.  They got all of our orders mixed upo. Will never go back and cannot recommend this place.  PS  one dish was good and some enjoyed the soup.  There are 100 places I will visit before returning to this place.|0
$8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg, two greasy strips of bacon, and a stale muffin. They say it's pricy because they get it local? It has to have substance to be considered anything. So whack.|0
"What are you all talking about?! This place is awful. Theres a reason why these sandwiches are $3. I can't believe so many people like this place, (although the place was filled with the Chinese people and they have been known to have different taste buds ) You get a 10 inch piece of bread with a bunch of stringy cheap vegetables. From what they said, there was meat on there too,  however i forgot to bring my microscope to verify if there was any on there. This place is like a middle school cafeteria smack dab in the heart of Tokyo's slums (i don't know any Vietnamese cities). Please, homeless people, save your quarters, you're too good for this place. They have good milkshakes, but if you really are homeless (as you should be if you're going to Lee's) you shouldn't be buying ""rich people"" milk shakes anyways, stick with the dollar menu."|0
I just thought I'd post an update.  I planned never to go back, but was with a friend who really wanted one of their breakfast items.  I skipped ordering ANY food whatsoever and merely ordered coffee and watched her eat.  As fate would have it, she had a BACK HAIR in her scrambled eggs (we are 2 for 2 now).  My gag reflex is going off as I type this.  My husband, friends, and I have renamed this place the Black Hair Diner, and we've decided they have actual black bears cooking in the kitchen, since they can't seem to keep black hairs out of their food.|0
"No.    If you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai, that is what I will say.   0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson.    0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it.  In this case, I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo, and both in Tempe.  The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one.    The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.  On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant.  On entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me.  He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.    There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?  Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED!  When I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water.  The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of ""I am the only staffperson here...""  I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.  Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isn't filthy, but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception.   6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.  The phone rang again.  Staffperson's attention was no longer on me.  The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away.  I asked if he had heard me.  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.  He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson.  I said I would wait.  Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction.    6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.  The phone rang as he left the table,  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.    6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.    6:20 PM, staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro.  On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated ""This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish"".  I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation.  6:25 pm.  As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber.  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know.  I stood and left.  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have ""The Best Curry in the Valley"",   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.  For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.  Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson, I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business."|0
Brought a group to Metro for brunch, made the reservation a month ago, called three days ago to update and ask to be outside and people arrived and were told there was no reservation. Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate.   Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic. Not enough menus, slow, horrible drinks, no silverware, soup was burnt-how do you burn soup??? Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us.   I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro.   They have recently changed management, unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore.  Update 11/8/2010 Since my first review I received a $50 gift certificate from the management of Metro.  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends.  I knew I couldn't just go with one other person, it had to be a group to show what they could do.    We arrived at 9:15 and were seated on the patio.  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough, I never saw her again.  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full.  Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu.  We ordered beignets, apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight.  The beignets and apple bread pudding were good.  The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all.  Jesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section.|0
Closed... GONE UNDER, OUTTA HERE.. See ya later, bye bye..|0
If we were able to give 0 stars... I would ask to give -1.  I live nearby, and am sad to see that a coffeeshop that sells coffee this horrible is still in business in my neighborhood.  Not only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting, so was the process of watching the barista make my drink.  They use hershey's chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides, and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle.  *Disgusting.    The espresso shot was made without care, or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly, and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door.  Possibly way before the barista started her shift.   *Gross  And finally.  The milk.  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.  This was a huge red flag.  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well, both were accomplished.   The steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use.  Which is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING.  I wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha, and threw it away after taking a sip.    Hundreds of businesses in the area close down every year, and there are more realty signs in strip malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts.  AND I really don't understand why this place hasn't joined the many defunct businesses and starry eyed entrepreneurs in the unemployment line.    If you own a coffeeshop.  Coffee should be your passion.   If you own a bait shop.  Fishing should be your passion. If you just want to open up a business that mirrors a nearby popular chain (short, tall, grande), please stop wasting space in the strip mall and get a day job in a cubicle.  Never going back, warning my friends about this place, and am probably going to contact the health department on Monday.|0
Rental car review.  118 degrees.  Standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus.  10 minutes go by and I have seen 3 busses leave with out of service signs.  Another 10 minutes pass and no active duty busses.  Finally, a bus!  We have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside.  5 minutes later he comes back on the bus and we drive 10 miles an hour the whole way to the terminal.  PHX...pay attention.  Business travelers do not appreciate being left in the heat for 20 minutes watching out of service busses pass by.|0
Let's talk about failure, baby.  Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it!  I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldn't be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.    This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. It's really *that* terrible.  I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely, and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for.|0
This place is a dump. I'm a widow, and I have a long-term chronic condition, still, they allowed their tenant to pick on me, throw a bottle at me, then their maintenance person told me the lock was never changed, They did not paint, but lied and said they did. It's totally drug-infested, They don't keep their word.  I would skip it.|0
So i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place, I would support the first amendment with my wallet. Unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least. We came in on a 3pm on Saturday and there was only one other couple inside. We were literally outnumbered by the people working there. I say this because somehow, despite this fact, the service was HORRENDOUS. I mean we got our order out fine, but our waitress dissappeared after that. At one point I had to almost get refills for us myself. The sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was. The Philadelphia roll was decent, but the California roll was really bad. When it came to paying, I put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile. Despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table, the waitress didn't return. If it wasn't for the cash I had on me I'd be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!|0
"It's a supermarket.  I just go in buy what I need and get out.  It's convenient that there's a wells fargo in there, but there's one across the street as well.    To the negative experience..... My sister was speaking to my niece, but not in english.  Some caucasian lady walks by and rudely says, ""Can't you speak english?""  WTF?!?  Is this taking SB 1070 in your own hands?  It's like you're trying to make every race hate you even more.  I will run into this arrogance wherever I go.  I'm not done yet.  Keep on reading.... My niece had a dollar in her hand and was pointing at the lottery scratcher machine.  We know you have to be of a certain age to play it.  One of the employees there rushes over and in a loud voice tells me niece she can't play it.  Calm down.  Kids are just innocent and don't need this extra verbal abuse in their lives.  Don't you have something better to do like restock the shelves?  Swear... Racial profiling."|0
The bill was 150.00 and that was after a free appetizer coupon they sent me via email.  The food was no where near worth the HIGH price!  The service was not up to par either.  I really can't believe people pay such high prices for food that come with NO sides, etc.  I got iced tea to drink and it cost a whopping $6.00.  That's right folks....6.00 for a glass of tea.  What is that 100% profit/mark up?  I paid 12.00 for a soup sampler.  Each of the three soups were in a tiny espresso cup.  My salmon was no better than what I get at Texas roadhouse but it was three times the price.  I would definitely not recommended this place.  If you want a fancy, awesome meal go to Houston's!  The one thing that was great were the rolls (they were free too)!  Don't get me wrong the food is good but not worth the price tag!  You can get just as good food a lot of other places for a lot cheaper!|0
This has to be the worst restaurant in terms of hygiene. Two of my friends had food -poisoning after having dinner here. The food is just unhealthy with tons of oil floating on the top of curries, and I am not sure if any health/hygiene code is followed here.  The service is poor and the information on its website is incorrect, the owner does not allow dine-in after 9 or 10 even though it says that the restaurant is open till 11.   One night I saw the owner cleaning the place without gloves and she was nice enough to give us a to-go parcel without cleaning her hands (great example to the servers!). I had a peek inside the kitchen when the door was ajar, and it definitely looked dirty.  I have been a lot of hole-in-the-wall places around this restaurant, including Haji Baba, the Vietnamese place and others, but neither any of my friends nor I have fallen sick coz of the food. If you need a spicy-food fix, i strongly recommend you do not try this place, lest you want a visit to the doctor the very next day.|0
Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago... Unfortunately for them, I also sampled Ollie Cakes... No wonder Ollie Cakes, aka Urban Cookie, won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake.  Drive a few miles north, get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon, and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldn't know yummy if it bit them on the butt!  Really, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry... And I can't say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... As their products now do, at least to me.|0
Won't be going there again. Our chicken was pink! Manager was a prick in regards to that and service was all around crappy.|0
"See the huge sign outside that says $2.50? Yeah, that's for shirts only. I was caught off guard when I brought in my skirt and got nailed for about $3.79. As I sadly handed over my $5 bill, the lady at the counter said a lot of people had told her they felt betrayed by the sign outside. No kidding. I had originally been heading down the street to Regal on 7th Ave.--who does a fine job in half the pickup time--for the ""advertised"" fake price here. Trying to make the best of it,  I told the lady at least I'd learned they had an onsite alteration service, and maybe that was worth a buck. UH OH. Picked up my skirt a few weeks later with some Jersey Shore-type chick at the counter, and was told I owed another $3.79. I flat-out refused to pay twice. She screamed at me, chased me to my car, wrote down my license plate and said the police would be visiting. Ni-i-i-ice."|0
No offense to everyone who gave this place 5 stars, but the Tempe Cinema staff needs a swift kick in the ass. During school hours, this place is regularly crawling with hooligan truants. Maybe those who run this theatre want to ensure they will have a steady stream of staffing options from the dropouts who use it as a hideout. Losers.|0
in addition to sucking, it's also expensive.|0
I guess this is an east coast/midwest thing because I really don't get it. I'm not a picky eater and I HATE wasting food and money, but I could not finish my plate. I ordered french toast and I was not aware that my french toast was going to be deep fried. Seriously, when I put my fork through it, a piece of fried toast hit me in the eye. My husband was also not impressed with his food. If someone would like to suggest something delicious on the menu that I should try, please let me know because I currently want to vomit every time I see a Chompie's.|0
"This was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I paid $20.00 for a show and dinner. I received the show only because it was from an outside source. The show was 2 hours long and by the time it was over half the restaurant I'd say 50 to 80 people still had not been served. They didn't have enough menu's for people to even order off of. Some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table. The show started at 7:00, at 9:30 I still had no food. The people who did get food complained that it was terrible. Maybe I should be happy I didn't get any food. When I asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it. The guys in the kitchen were overheard saying ""f---k those people no more orders! not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back. We ended up at Dennys eating eggs at 11:00 . Seriously I've never had such a bad experience in my life. Can you imagine paying for a dinner then being refused the dinner or a refund? unbelievable"|0
Wow.....  Not in a good way  The sashimi was good because all they did was cut it, but that was it.everything else made me wish I went real Chinese! Not Chinese making sushi, culture theives! P.S. snow crab is not the main ingredient to every roll!|0
After looking for a car wash & vacuum in the area I selectioned Francis & Sons. I checkeed thier priced on thier website, but when I got thier the price they wanted to charge was much more, they kept trying to sell an upholstery cleaning, and then said I don't take care of my care so there would be an additional $20 to clean the black plastic exterior pieces. I only wanted a qhick exterior  clean and vacuum. They refused to honor thier website pricing and insisted that what I read on thier website was not on there. Needless to say I didn't get my car washed there. I would highly recommend AVOIDING these crooks.|0
This place has gone so downhill. If I hadnt gotten my chips, salsa & water immediately, I wouldve walked out. Margaritas are always awesome. But the service and food is straight up AWFUL. Microwaved enchiladas, no rice, rude, cold, unfriendly, uninviting service...If you're looking for a fabulous, neighborhood mexican restaurant, try Las Glorias Grill. The location isnt as great, but the food, service and drinks, blows this place outta the water. After years of going to aunt chiladas, Im NEVER going back again. They dont deserve your money either....|0
I'm not sure what all of the buzz is about because this place wasn't that great! I had the grilled cheese and it was hard and dry!  There was this nasty drunk guy who sat across from our table and it was quite sickening! I will not be going back!|0
"I've now tried Thai Elephant three times.  My first two experiences were solidly mediocre -- nothing was awful, but aside from one delicious dessert (black sticky rice with pumpkin custard), nothing stood out, either.  As a recent Bay Area transplant, I admit to being a bit picky, but in my 6 months in Phoenix, I've found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings (Swadee in Chandler, Thai Lahna in Arcadia, Sala Thai in North Phoenix, and, in a pinch, Thai Hut in Central Phoenix).  Until now, Thai Elephant hadn't really done it for me, but since the restaurant is literally 40 feet from my office and since other Yelpers seem to have had positive experiences, I was reluctant to give up on Thai Elephant without giving it another chance.  On Friday, looking forward to a relaxing night at home, I called in an order for Pad Thai with chicken, Panang Curry with beef (extra spicy), and Spicy Eggplant with tofu (spicy, which I thought would be automatic given the name, but apparently wasn't).  I got home, meted out ridiculously oversized portions of the three entrees, and sat down to enjoy my feast.  Wow.  I don't know quite where to begin, but to say that I was disappointed doesn't begin to cover it.  The Pad Thai was about on par with the Taste of Thai boxed dinners you can pick up at the grocery store, only less flavorful; marginal at best, but edible.  The chicken didn't stand out as being of particularly low quality, but the noodles were some of the worst I've had at a Thai restaurant (some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy, while others were seriously soggy).  Sadly, the sub-par Pad Thai was the high point of the meal by a wide margin.  The Spicy Eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy, overcooked vegetables and limp tofu.  The tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block and then sliced, and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure.  The Panang Curry with beef was even worse.  Though I ordered the dish ""spicy,"" the curry tasted like straight coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown in.  The beef was the last straw for me; it very may well have been the worst quality, most gristly meat I've had at any restaurant I've ever been to.  I tried several pieces, and all were similarly inedible.  I really, really want to like Thai Elephant, but after the experience I had, I don't know if I can bring myself to give it another chance -- especially since I've found so many other good Thai restaurants in the Valley and since the second-worst Thai meal I've had since moving here was at Thai Elephant's sister restaurant, Thai Basil in Ahwatukee."|0
My son and his family arrived into Scottsdale Tuesday April 10 on there way to California. We decided to eat at RnR before they continued there trip.  My son and my wife ordered a hamburger and fries. The fries had no taste and my son asked for two new orders. My grandchildren ate the original fries, while the new fries loaded with Parmesan cheese. The fries were not hot, nor had the cheese melted. I had a few of the fries and did not have as severe a case of food poisoning as my son and my wife.   I have recommended RnR in the past. I do not think I will in the future.|0
I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it, served in a aluminum take-out box. The tables are folding tables, like the kind you play beer pong on. And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too, which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine, it creeped me out.|0
Went last week, and ordered a dozen variety. I didn't care for any of them, very dry, the frosting wasn't very good,even my 9 yr old daughter spit her cupcake out!|0
I had high hopes for this place, and it is really too bad because I love to support the Phoenix area restaurants, especially a Caribbean one and I had already been to the adjoining Rum Bar and loved the drinks, but the food was bad.  It was not only bad, but by all means avoid the daily market catch.  It was not fresh at all!  Very over priced!  For nearly $25 for a simple white fish they could have at least taken the bones out of the thing.  It tasted like it had been sitting around all day (or two) in its own juices, and when I let the waiter/bartender know he just ignored it and then ignored us until we left.  I will never be back for the food.  The Rum flights are worth a trip there, but that is it.|0
this is a business located in the fry's grocery strip mall on mckellips and recker I wont say much but don't bother the waitless girl was about as pleasent as a hemroid the beer selection sucked. I belive the owner was there at least the guy looked like the owner. it's always amazing to me how the service can be so horrible w/owner in house.|0
Slow, unorganized and filled to the brim with crazy people. I prefer to do everything through the service arizona website but recently got a letter that I needed to get a new license because my picture was going to expire. It makes total sense that my license is valid until I'm 65 but the picture expires after 11 years. Of course, the state charges a nominal fee of $12 to replace it. If the state of AZ was in need of my money I'd gladly just give it to them if it means avoiding this nightmare. Oh, and the camera is set to fat...|0
Look it upsets me that you have to give even one star.   I can read the other reviews and I have been here more than a few times but tonight it was just beyond a bad dinner.   Yes, we were the table of 7 people at about 8pm, yes we were group at the high top tables that were pushed together. You would have to remember us because we were the table that had 1/2 of a waiter. It was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch.   You know what sucks more than working 2 shifts? How about being the last table for the guy who worked 2 shifts, it was so nice of the manager to let him leave, but hey how about taking the time to have someone FINISH the open orders?   Simply the food was not good and you are over priced.  But the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job, THEY DONT CARE and that is a result of MANAGEMENT not caring.|0
Staff was very rude, bowling prices weren't displayed to the best of their ability, extreme bowling itself was over priced almost $20 per person. The only thing about their extreme bowling was that it was extremely hot, temperature wise. they had many ceiling fans and not one of them turned on. And the bowling equipment malfunctioned three times during our games. It was not a pleasant experience and I don't believe we'll be going to this facility again.|0
My husband and I have Been meaning to go in here and see if it was anything like hong kong gourmet, so yesterday for lunch we decided to give it a try. Huge mistake! The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (I'm unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didn't even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didn't even eat. We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back. Don't do it, you will regret it!|0
The music is pounding...  It reeks of ridiculously strong cologne masking young adult male insecurity...  Some guy younger than my kid brother is walking around without a shirt...  Everything is super overpriced for what you get...  In the grand tradition of overcompensation and brand whoring there is a name plastered all over everything...  No one is genuine either in their efforts to help or able to make real eye contact and stop texting...  Is it a bar in Belltown in the late 90s? Is it a frat party? Is it a spring break trip?  No, it's Pimpercrombie & Bitch! Now I remember why it had been at least ten years since the last time I walked in one of these cesspools of humanity and child labor sweatshops. Maybe next time I will wait 20 years...if they make it that long.|0
I don't get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.|0
"Terrible food, terrible service.  I ordered chicken fried rice. The waiter brings me a bowl and says, ""chicken fried rice, right?"" I look into the bowl and it's a bowl of brown rice. This must be a joke. I tell him that's wrong, and next me brings me a bowl of rice, seemingly fried?, with vegetables and no chicken. I bring that back to the counter and say my order had chicken in it, bringing my receipt along. So finally, they bring me a bowl of chicken fried rice.  Or at least their version of it.  I didn't think it was possible to actually screw up something as simple as chicken fried rice. The rice itself was cheap long grain rice. It was inedible due to the how stale/hard it was. Like absolutely no water absorption. And the rice was all covered in something that made it very wet and practically slimy. Disgusting. I have no idea how people can eat this.  Oh, and that server who brought me the brown rice and claimed it was fried rice tried to bring lettuce wraps to the table next to me saying it was their salad. There's a nice picture on the wall which shows you what the salad is supposed to look like, and it's not lettuce wraps.  The best thing about my meal was the fountain drink, which cost $1.85. The Circle K in the same plaza has bigger cups for 99 cents."|0
veerrrrrryyyyyyyyy dirty. I think I will buy them some clorox wipes and light bulbs for their sign out front. I made 12 u-turns trying to find this place.|0
Horrible! I had a gel manicure. The tech didn't let my old gel soak off long enough so she scraped, clipped and filed so hard to get it off that it left my natural nail extremely thin and flimsy. The new polish that was put on was thick in some areas and thinner in others. I didn't realize it until I got home. I grabbed my purse and almost broke my naturally long nails because they were so frail. I get the gel manicure because it has a thicker finish and makes my nails firmer. I called and told them about what happened. The gentleman who answered the phone told me that I was wrong and that they would not refund my money. I will never go back and I am sure sorry I ever did in the first place.|0
"I will be moving to Phoenix in the Winter and I thought I'd scout out some LFS while I was visiting, which led me to Reef Culture. At first I was positive seeing some nice looking displays and LED use, however this soon changed.   On closer inspection, lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae, and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home. The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down. When I did manage to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos).   After this rude and demeaning experience, I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish. I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps, amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me. There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to ""stop harassing the fish."" Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to ""harass"" any fish. After this rude treatment I promptly left. This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too).   I won't be doing business here when I move."|0
NO.  Don't go. Don't do it.  This was my first visit and it was on a whim because we drive by it often.    One other reviewer here made a wise statement - go the grocery store and buy frozen fish.  I promise it will be better than this.|0
Music was loud as shit.  The food, Jesus Christ the food.  Lame ass chips and salsa.  No joke, like 8 chips were on the plate.  Salsa was probably one of the worst I've had, no flavor at all and warm.   Salads come out warm (I'm assuming this is why I've been puking).  Gross right, warm lettuce.  Waiter let's us know they can make daughter a little quesadilla (cheese only) which comes out so greasy.  Our taco plates come out 10 minutes later.  2 dinky tacos on each plate that are flavorless and luke warm at best.  Yes, they are spicey, no that does not mean they are flavorful.  I'm literally using my cell phone to see what was on the plate it's so dark.  Mint water was warm.  Gross and not refreshing whatsoever.  My daughter's quesadilla was $13, yes for 2 tortillas smaller than my hand and some 'cheese'.  I get it- make a dollar, but damn, don't rip your customers off.  So over the top lame.  Neither my husband nor myself finished.   Meal was $46.  Horrible.  Health department should go temp that place- I'm not sure the refrigeration is working properly.  Such a disappointment, I've been a vegetarian for 18 years- was looking forward to a new spot.  Won't be returning.  Ever.|0
Hot fudge Sunday was watered down so much. You would do much better by going to mcdonalds. This isn't the first time. I should quit giving this place chances. I'm disappointed every time. I once asked for hot fudge on the bottom of my sundae and was charged $2.60 more. The staff is rarely friendly. They should consider being friendly since it IS Dairy Queen, a place that takes many of us back to our childhoods. The array of desserts are so wonderful why not serve them wonderfully and with a smile, and not like you hate your job and just want to go home?|0
I used to love Banana Republic.  I stopped by at lunch to buy a few outfits, I wasted quite a bit of time in this store...to an frazzeling degree.  The choppy layout of the new store is annoying.  The clothing line changed drastically so you look like you just came from an overpriced (and cold) beach.  I was looking to dress sharp and professional, not wrinkled and hap-hazzard.  I wanted short sleeves, not flimsy spagetti straps, long sleeved blouses and SWEATERS (hello..its JUNE...and ARIZONA.)  Banana Republic's new format and collection is a huge FAIL.|0
I found Lisa G's while driving through phoenix with a friend. The exterior looked promising and we prepared ourselves for a treat. We were in for a a shock! We ordered the antipasto plate and while there were serious issues with it, it turned out to be the best thing we were served. I ordered the chicken rolatini (the special of the day) and it was just plain bad! The chicken was dry and under seasoned, the Rosemary potatoes were soggy  and the veggie medley  (squash, corn, green beans, etc.) was over cooked and the juices spilled over into the potatoes. It was one of the worst $17 meals that I have ever had! My friend ordered the veggie salad and it was one literal hot mess. Just horrible food! I see that others had the mini burgers and bowl of balls and found them to be tasty. I wish I had ordered those. As it is this is one place I would never revisit or recommend to a friend!|0
After sitting at our table for 30 minutes and not getting any service, we left.  But not before the hostess said thanks for coming in. Needles to say I will not be returning.|0
Here's the 1. 2. 3...  1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job. 2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately, they're all shitty. 3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno!   We'll be back for the food. It might be take out next time though!  4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly, I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks, just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work, Kid!|0
"Banfield is okay for routine check ups for maintenance and preventive care. That is why they offer a ""wellness plan"". When it comes to your animal getting sick, I would go elsewhere. It should not be called a Hopital. The doctors are there for profit only and do not show any care for your pet. The vet techs care, but the doctors don't listen to them. This place is lacking ethics when it comes down to making important decisions when it comes to your pets health."|0
"I got on the internet and looked at the menu and called in the order. I informed Brother's that I had a $3 coupon also and would pick up the perpperoni pizza and sampler and they said it would be 20 minutes.  At the register I was charged $12.95 for the $8.95 sampler.  I told the cashier that the internet menu had it listed for $8.95.  She just smiled and said ""Oh, we get that a lot but we don't have a menu.""  I said, ""but it's on the internet with your address/web page""  and she said, ""yeh, I know we get that a lot but here's our menu""  and she handed me their copy-machine menu which did not even have the sampler listed.  I politely told her that they should take the menu off the internet if it's not right.  The sampler was 4 pieces each of wings, mushrooms, cheese sticks, zuchinni.  The sampler was just like frozen generic small pieces ""out-of-the-freezer-bag"" deep fried.     I live near and our family had hoped to make this our weekly outing for pizza; however, I'll go elsewhere for better food and prices.  I also don't like false advertising.    A customer's frustration should be a business owner's learning opportunity to make their business better.  They can learn a lot from their customers."|0
THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!!  It really deserves NO STARS!!!  You can only like this place if you don't know anything about Vietnamese food.   What I tried...  Bun Bo Hue:  Broth didn't even taste like Bun Bo Hue.  Spicy but has no flavor.  Where's the beef shank or hog's feet?  You can't have Bun Bo Hue without the shank or hog's feet.  They use the cheapest cuts of meat.  This item was on their Daily Special.    Pho Chin Nam:  The broth was super sweet.  You know what that means....MSG galore!!!!  Not even a hint of Anise star in the broth.  How can you specialize in Pho if you can't even make the broth taste right?  Service stinks.  I hate it when the waiter holds the bowl in such a way that his thumb is on the inside of the bowl while serving it.  The dude never refill the water, ask how things were, etc.  Vegetable platter was not fresh.  Bean sprouts were starting to brown.   If you can't cook something why even bother serving it to customers.  I don't know about other entrees they offer but I won't be coming back to find out.    This has to be one of the worse Vietnamese restaurant in the valley.   Check out my extensive list of Vietnamese Restaurants for suggestions to better ones.|0
"OVERPRICED & DECEITFUL & RUDE!  I should have read the reviews before I came here! I took a bridesmaid dress in to have the top taken in like 1/4 inch, not much. I asked her, how much will this cost? She assured me it would not be ""much"". It was $60 and she hardly did a thing, can't even steam it there. I was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed NO! She said it's because the dress cost more. Yeah...like that matters A guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken OUT which is a lot more work, she charge him $18.50 for each pair. I don't know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off!  Previously I've been to 5th Avenue Alterations and they charge me $50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing AND steamed it. They're also polite and will work with you on pricing and communicate with you beforehand. Definitely worth the few extra minutes of a drive!!"|0
La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem. It can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up, and that makes the overall experience iffy. Is it a quick mart? A grocery store? A restaurant? A coffee shop? Unfortunately, it can't be all of them.  I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary.  I'll certainly be back at night for the pizza, the delicious wings, and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO. But I'm afraid that I won't be back for the weekend chaos.|0
The wash ain't bad....but the process to get it done is pathetic.  The ticket writers at the entrance move in slow motion. They try to upsell at every opportunity.  Four cars backed up waiting to order their service...and the crew is standing around with no cars going thru. I'd rather drive my car dirty then endure the agony of incompetent management.|0
Only reason for 1 star is 'cause I got arrested here for underaged drinking years ago.  I blame the Diamondbacks, for no legitimate reason.|0
Food poisoning alert. There is no doubt in my mind that this incident was caused by the order of potato skins I was served at this un-fine dining establishment. First off, the cook looks like somebody off the street, at least wear an apron buddy.     Now we are watching the games there and it's about 30 minutes after I eat 4 fairly large skins which I dipped in sour cream and the rumbling in the stomach started. Five minutes later, I was depositing those skins in their tiny toilet and trying to hold on while the games ended. Lastly, another stop was needed on way home to drop off some more skins. This place is full of local drunks, but a good watering hole (yeah literally). Go here to drink and stay away from all food. Also, it was 8 bucks for one order of skins. Why do places charge the same price for apps as they do for sandwiches. It's another sign of a clueless place with poor food and hygiene. Bad choice.|0
We've been going here for 25 years and I had my first BAD meal recently. A rotten chicken tamale, the corn meal might have had rancid fat in it or the chicken was rotten, either way it was stinky. The wait staff didn't seem outraged and shrugged it off as though this has happened before.  I may go back here in another year, but Rosita's Place is off limits for me now.|0
You'll feel like you stepped in a time machine and landed in 1987.  The decor hasn't been updated in at least 20 years.  Looks like it's falling apart.  The TVs are mostly 80s style TVs as well, although there are a couple flat screens as well.  This is where the trash hangs out, of all colors.  The pizza was greasy (which I like) but also chewy (which was gross).  The wings were drowned so much in sauce you couldn't find them.  Might as well get a glass of honey bbq sauce and drink it straight.  Service was interesting.  The guy that worked there was wearing capri pants and had a higher voice than my girlfriend.  The price wasn't bad- I think it was like $22 for a large pizza, wings and 2 sodas.  I'd rather pay a little bit more and just go to Upper Crust pIzza down the street.|0
"I was severely mislead by Frank A's, ""It's hot, but the food ain't bad."" review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food I've ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return."|0
Went with three others. My first & last visit.  The menu did not properly describe the item and instead of a bell pepper dish, I got a port dish. It was dreadful. The other three I went with were not very happy with their meals either.  The restaurant was extremely noisy. Not pleasant at all & terrible food. Will never go back.  A big disappointment.  They can't even describe their items properly so you never know what you are going to end up with. They called it a pepper dish and it was a pork dish. The sauce apparently contained pulverized peppers. Are they stupid?  I should have trusted my instincts & not the commercial.  It's a third world country. They can barely afford to feed themselves. They have no history of cuisine.  I wouldn't waste my time and money on this place again.|0
Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980's attempt at a mexican restaurant.  Taco Bell is a step up!  But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you.|0
I'm very displeased with the service I receive from the Republican party in Arizona.  First, they provide us with John McCain.  Then, Jan Brewer.  Then they crap SB 1070 all over us, which we didn't even vote on.  I've never received anything but lousy politics from these people.|0
If you like the stuck up Scottsdale vibe this is a good place for you. The food isn't impressive. Nice outdoor seating.|0
Refused to give water to young teen & referred her to PF Changs.  Olive & Ivy handled this poorly, unprofessionally & pathetically.   PF Changs didn't even hesitate to give her the water.  That's why I ate there instead.|0
"I think chef Silvana Esparza first located the restaurant here on CALLE DIECISEIS (she renamed the street all by herself, apparently) to take advantage of cheap rent.  There was no way she was going to locate her Scottsdalish restaurant actually in Scottsdale.  So, people from the wealthier areas - and some First Friday urban hipsters whose parents foot their bills - make the trek down to CALLE DIECISEIS to partake in everything Barrio Cafe.  And they think it's cool that they are going there, past the check cashing places, the people waiting at the bus stops and the ""rawness"" of this part of central Phoenix.  And what is everything ""Barrio Cafe""????  Pretentious service. LOUD dining room. NO parking. Fusion food that is about 10 years past its prime. High prices.  Let's talk a little about the last item on the list.  Besides using vulgar language in her YouTube videos for pseudo social activism, Esparza seems to have forgotten her own humble upbringings.  It's ironic that the very people who live on and around CALLE DIECISEIS cannot afford to eat in her restaurant.  The Mexican immigrants and their sons and daughters who do the cooking, the cleaning, the landscaping and all that for Phoenix are not welcome at the Barrio Cafe.  I know that this is not a taco truck, but there is some overwhelming irony here that you locate your restaurant in a working class area and supposedly have sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden and the neighbors can't even eat  at your restaurant.  I guess that's capitalism.  Like that new car, by the way."|0
I do enjoy a good bowl of Pho.   This was -not- a good bowl of pho.  grey chicken meat., off tasting broth, old bean sprouts, 1 piece of a jalepeno pepper... dingy insides.  Weird looks from the server.  I don't think I'll be back.  Not much else I can say|0
So, there's no negative stars, too bad. Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing, you couldn't pay me to eat here.  The only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price. $10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings. Where'd they get their chef, Chili's? What a disappointment. All the reviews say ' a lot of food' ...for who, an infant?  I had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well. Didn't know deep fried, greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called 'cookies'. Good grief, the bakery wasn't even good! Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling.   The only good thing about Chandler Chompie's is Jason's Deli right next door.|0
Tried to eat here Friday night for the seafood buffet. We waited in line for 90 minutes before finally giving up. Would have been much sooner but the drive down there from my house is almost an hour.   They have three lines, tiered based on the level of player's club card. The diamond card holders waltzed right in and the hostesses would seat from that line until it was empty before anyone from the 'lesser' lines would be seated. At the end, we stood still... didn't move an inch... for 20 minutes. So no-one from our line was seated for 20 minutes while dozens of people waltzed right through in the diamond and platinum lines.   What a fucking joke. Waster my whole evening trekking down there dreaming of crab legs just to be snubbed by them.  Never, EVER again.|0
pretentious and bad service - attendants are totally clueless (though I feel for them if management makes them wear the costumes they wear). overpriced fashion brands.  if you want to spend $200 on a flannel, there are MUCH better options out there.  run in and glance at the sale rack, otherwise avoid this place like the plague.|0
I don't know what's up with Eddie??? I always found him to be pleasant, and really taking care of the customers. However on the 17th of November we had a birthday party of 19 people, and they gave us one waitress. We sat down at 7:00 pm and our main course came at 9:15. No real big deal but one person can't handle a table of 19, and we were having fun. So one of the guest's had ordered the $12.00 burger along with a salad and told the waitress no Mayo because he can't stand it at all. The burger comes out and it has Mayo on it, and he tells the waitress. She was not at fault, and had written it down clearly. He asked for a new one, and she comes back and say's Eddie cooked the hamburger and refused to cook a new one but would make him a new bun. He didn't want that because he hates Mayo that much, so there was no problem taking it off the tab, but Eddie would not make a new one. LOL. What's up Eddie??? I don't understand at all, you take it off the bill because you screwed up, but refuse to make another burger that you would have been paid for.  Then you end up looking like a fool in front of the other eighteen people. My daughter has even taken one of your classes, and said what a great guy you are. Really, Really bad PR that night and the next birthday party wont be at Eddie's House. Great time that night, but the ending leaves a very bad taste in 19 people's mouth.|0
"I was really excited about this event, maybe my expectations were too high, because I was really underwhelmed.  Very little shade, ran out of water, by the time I got there at 1pm (other obligations) 20% of the vendors were out of food, and by the time I ate my way through some, everyone else was already out.   60 bucks for that?  I don't think so.    And when I mentioned it to ""the person in charge"", he was patronizing, invalidating and kept telling me how happy the chefs were.  Well, I'm your consumer, big guy.    Sorry, Devoured, wish it could have been better.   What food I did try, was pretty good."|0
The staff is friendly. But the physical hotel itself itself is comparable to a 2 star motel. The Holiday Express I stayed at is better than this. Priceline tricked me when I requested for a 4 star and indicated that this was a 4 star in name your own price.  Cons: 1) They have cactus in the parking lot where when I got home late, it was dark, poorly lit lot, and opened my car door, step out of the car, and step on to cactus severely injuring my foot to where I can not walk anymore. Who puts low cactus in a dimly lit parking lot where when you get out of a car, someone can step on it? Being injured on vacation is no fun and very painful! 2) hotel room and property is old, like from the 1980s though the front desk boy told me that the rooms were newly renovated 3) Given the previous reviews I asked for a quiet room, but was given a room where the squeeking and thumping and wall shaking, woke me up at 5 in the morning. The neighbors flushing the toilet, showering, and running water can all be heard. 4) the bathroom door is so jammed that it requires both hands, all of my body wait and a few minutes of wrestling with it to open/close it 5) Requested a single bed, however upon arrival, was told that it would be 30/extra a night for a single bed instead of 2 doubles 6) 80s style tube TV  7) pink 80s decor 8) worn down bed with body dent in it 9) wifi costs 9.99/for 24 hours even though its signal is only 1 bar 10) AC blasts loudly on and off during the night 11) curtains are cut half way so tons of light comes in to the room in the morning.   pros:  1) location 2) staff smiles and says hi 3) cleaning staff does a good job|0
I was excited to go to the lululemon athletica at Scottsdale Quarter because I really enjoyed shopping at the previous store that closed in Scottsdale. Well something has changed... I walked into the store and while there were more sales clerks than customers, no one said a word to me and no one asked if I needed any help. They were all too busy talking with one another. And to add insult to to injury... one clerk had to walk around me (didn't ask if I needed help) and went to play with one of the customers dogs.... I had fully intended to buy a Christmas gift there, but left because the service was so poor and I did need help with the sizing.   I went over to the Nike store and had a totally different experience, very positive.  I'll stick with Lucy and Nike where they appreciate their customers.|0
Door clearly says drive-thru open 24 hours and lobby till midnight. Drove up at 10:30 and was told the lobby was closed...lame...|0
"Service was slow and horrible. Got the steak and eggs.  Steak was half fat. Waiters response was ""Oh!  We have a new supplier"". He didnt take it back and charged us any way. Eggs were cold. Stay away from this place for eating. Bar looked happening."|0
"Still a place that is unacceptable in my book--especially when a server there goes out of their way to message me privately on Yelp to complain about my punctuation, and signing off--every so ""sincerely"" i might add, with: "" love the B*tchy waitress from AZ88.  Way to keep it classy over there....."|0
We found a bandaid with the panang.  We ordered panang with chicken, not panang with bandaid.   When we told the waiter, he argued that it wasn't a bandaid.  I'm sorry, there's no mistaking a bandaid!  The icing on the cake was that they charged us for it!!!  If you like bandaid on your dish, this I the place to go!  Too bad yelp doesn't allow 0 stars. This place definitely was a ZERO.|0
"Don't do business at this unethical business. My $25 savings account from 2009 was  recently stolen from $5 a month for ""account inactivity"" fees. They are a bunch of crooks.  It appears you now need to nickle and dime your customers with BS fees in order to stay in business.   Account closed."|0
My husband and I went to Ernie's a few weeks ago on a Saturday night because it is within walking distance to our house and there is always a crowd so we wanted to check it out. We met our friends in the bar and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. Still no-one offered to take our drink order.   The bartenders and barbacks made eye contact but no-one came near us. We don't look like hooligans or ruffians or anything so it was irritating. The weird thing was there were people eating in the booths around us, and one or two other people at the bar (who had drinks.) We finally got up and left. Why waste money on places that won't take it! I won't return and will recommend my friends don't either!|0
whole foods whole paycheck wholly sh$t i am sorry there prices are rediculous the only reason i went there is because since moving here from a very foody town certain products are nearly impossible to find and they do have them but you will pay, my search today was mushroms not button but chantrel/oyster/ect i was going to get every thing on my list but when i saw shallots at 4.95 a lb i bought my shrooms and split the i hit frys, shallots 2.49 a lb and of course theres always trader joes|0
My part Jewish friend has been raving about this deli so come payday we went to check it out. Ive been in Phoenix a little over a month and have been getting sick from the food here...diarrhea lots, shit my pants once... anyway, i like to eat in divey non-american cuisine. This place aint seedy enough for me, I suppose.  I did not get ill from the food here  However....   $12.95 for a sandwich, fries, and a dollop of soggy coleslaw ???  I kept hearing from my friend, his mom and the waitress that the sandys are HUGE. nope.  Thought we might split one. nope.  My sandwich was flavorless..err..thats a lie.. it tasted like stale bread.  $29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!). I only had $40 (only ?)  Left the waitress $5.  Gave my friend the other $5 to put toward a plane ticket to New York where he might experience Kosher (and a bit of his heritage) on a more realistic scale.  ..the fries were good tho.|0
Donuts are worst I've ever had. I bought 2 dozen donuts using their 10.99 sale and it was the worst donuts I have ever had in my life. All the donuts were dry and stale. I should have gone a couple of miles over and bought Krispy Kreme. Krispy Kreme donuts are always fresh. These ones were worst that those that sat on the shelf for a week in a supermarket!|0
I don't like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice.  The ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross.  The ingredients are not fresh but rather canned (also gross).  The chicken wings were not that great either.  The atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen TV's on the wall.  I will not be going back to this place, so hopefully they get better soon since Barro's pizza is going in the area soon.|0
Horrible service.|0
My love affair with Pita Jungle is a long one.....perhaps longer than any other restaurant, certainly longer than I can remember, and at least for the adult portion of my life, which is why it pains me to write this review.   For the last 6 months, I have ordered takeout one day a week from this location, typically on a Friday or Saturday. The ridiculousness that has become my adult life has necessitated a heavy reliance on takeout for my main source of nourishment. Although the food is always spot on at Pita, my takeout experience has been anything but.   The prior 3 out of 4 times I went to pick up my food, I ended up waiting past the promised time. Now I'm not unreasonable, waiting 5 or 10 minutes is not a big deal, but each time has been a wait of 25 to 30+ minutes past the pick up time, with no apologies or explanations. I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there. The last time I must've looked really irritated, because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait.   Used to the wait, I started showing up 5 to 10 minutes past the promised time, just as preventative maintenance. Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time. I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face. I get back to my friend's house, open the bag, and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up. We ordered 4 items, 3 of which were wrong. I load one item up and head back to Pita. Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing, but blatantly screwing up my order is too much. As I explain my situation to the takeout girl, she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong. As I struggle to keep my cool, I inform them that they must be mistaken. One item was ordered with chicken, my item was turkey, and the other two were salads. Everything came with chicken. The salads were for my vegetarian friends, and I'm allergic to chicken. There's no way you're going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians. Sorry, try again. Without too much ado, the correct dishes were provided, and yet another obligatory baklava was offered. I declined. There is only so much wrong that baklava can right. Don't get me wrong, their baklava is amazing, but it's not going to make up for them screwing up my order, then trying to blame it on me. Oh, and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer? Too bad the coupon expires in a few days.   I'm afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere, until enough time has passed that maybe, just maybe, I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle. In the meantime, I suggest you try to get it together down there. In case you missed the count, that's 4 out of the last 5 takeouts you missed the mark on, including 1 you tried to blame on me. That's shameful.|0
WOW!  I have never been to a place with service this horrible.  I may have caught them on a bad night, but I'm not giving them a second chance to find out!  I came in with a group of 4.  We stood up front for 5-10 minutes before waving someone down to be seated.  That was a mistake..  As we're waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us.  We stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order, it was like being in the Twilight Zone.  After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees, we just walked out laughing, no one had even apologized for the wait, I'm not sure they even saw us leave!  It was the strangest restaurant experience of my life.  What a joke...  **EDIT**  To their credit, right after I posted this review, I received a message explaining that the Director of Operations would like to amend the situation, even going so far as to include their cell number.  I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews, I'm assuming I caught them on a really bad night.  I'll edit this if I ever return to the restaurant, but the fact that someone actually reached out to try to rectify things says something|0
"Pros:  -No breed restrictions on dogs -Washer and dryer in unit  Cons:  -Awful and idiotic leasing staff. Forms will be missing or prepared incorrectly. -Rude and inadequate maintenance (be prepared to supply your own tools half of the time) -Trash divers daily that no one does anything about -No on-site security (you can call after 9 pm for a ""courtesy patrol"" but it takes them hours to arrive) and the front gate is NEVER closed -Vandalized cars  -A MURDER (this was the location of the man who set his pregnant girl friend on fire) -The main pool is beautifully maintained and clean. The 3 other pools are small, dirty, and frequently closed.  -Bug infestations in most apartments -Dogs kept on patios 24/7 (a clear violation of the lease) so their barking can be heard by all -The basketball court and tennis courts are never available, as they are constantly used by kids to bike ride on with the encouragement of the apartment staff -Tons of potholes! Driving through the parking lot requires excellent shocks and there is minimal guest parking -The apartments have less insulation than a cardboard box. Freezing in the winter, sweltering in the summer. Nothing is fitted correctly to it's frame, either.   If you can afford a better place, I highly reccommend it."|0
"I ate at Scramble last Friday and I have to say that it was a horrible experience.  What attracted me to this place was the separate vegan menu in addition to their regular menu - this makes things easier when dining with vegan and non-vegan friends.  So I happily ordered a tofu wrap and added fried potatoes as a side and awaited my food.  We started eating and my friend found a hair in his food...not good!  He threw it on the floor and tried to drop it.  Well moments later I found a hair in my food...  I couldn't believe there was hair on both of our plates!  I was so disgusted I could no longer eat my food (and I was ravenous).  I told the girl working the register about the whole ordeal, she walked back to the kitchen then back to the register and completely ignored me (she said she'd come back to my table).  Before we left I spoke with someone else and showed them the hair, clearly not one of mine.  All I got was ""Oh, I'll check the guys in the back.""  Check the guys in the back???  What?  How about, sorry may I refund you your money?  Additionally, the few bites I had of my burrito were pretty bland, it needed seasoning or hot sauce.  Overall, I wouldn't go back...unless I somehow develop a taste for hair, although I'm sure that won't happen.  I did take a picture of my food before I attempted eating it and if you zoom in enough you can see part of the hair sticking out of my food - I'll be posting them."|0
"Yeah...notsomuch.  Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait . Or the chaos. Or the hype. Or the attitude from the morons who work there. Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include...  - The cupcakes are not that great. I ordered two. The vanilla was okay, the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.  - This place is a disorganized mess.   - There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid.  - The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions. No sane person could possibly work here without being like ""um...there might be a better way to do this...""  - Also, the employees were rude. Did I mention dumb?  So get this: I attempted to order a bottle of water. I told the clerk it's 100+ degrees outside, I walked there and I'm realllllllly thirsty. The idiot at the counter told me ""You can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it."" I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said ""NO"" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word ""water"") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.  I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!""   I said ""It's quite simple. Just hand me the water and I will hand you money. End of discussion."" (There are the actual words out of the mouth!)  She looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 5'4"" 110 lbs of fury. Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her. Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone.   I must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion. And I'm mad crazy passionate about my cupcakes, yo."|0
"Terrible service--they replaced my phone screen and it broke within 2 wks. Phone was not dropped or mishandled, just cracked and ""owner"" would not honor their warranty. They only accept cash--that should be a red flag if you are considering a business like this!"|0
"Easily the worst ""burrito"" I have ever had. It amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain. I bet the rations they serve from the back of UN trucks to refugees is better."|0
"Rude, rude, rude. I will *never* go back to this place. I don't normally carry cash and when I went to pick up my son's pants for his recital that night, I was in a little bit of a jam (they only take cash or checks). When I suggested they might put this on the claim ticket, or at least mention it when people drop off their clothes, the owner pointed to an itty bitty sign and told me ""we have signs everywhere."" The owner was hostile and argumentative and just didn't care about what I had to say. Then he hovered over me while my son tried his pants on, like I was going to steal something (the place is TINY). I went to an ATM and pulled out cash, it wasn't that big of a deal, but this place has no customer service skills whatsoever. I won't ever go there again. Steer clear."|0
Great at first, then the bartender ignored me and my friends for a good 20-30 minutes, put everyones bill on my tab. I opened a tab so this wouldn't happen then they made us wait another 15 for them just to ask us who had what. Then they over charged us by quit a bit. We had to flag someone f=down from napkins and plates and it took a few try's for a water. And to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long. There were three bartenders for what I handle myself at a bar on a daily basis. No sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager. He pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 45 min waiting or deal, just to close a check. Kind of a joke really.|0
"I was so looking forward to breakfast here. What a disappointment.  The food is the only thing that rates any stars at all. Good ingredients cannot be completely ruined by incompetent service.  The space is nice, but crowded and loud. The counter staff were indifferent. After being waved over to an open register, the fellow behind the counter took one order, then wandered off, leaving the rest of us to get back in line at the other register to order.  You are given a number (or not) and left to find your own table, scrounge up your own silverware, and wait for your food to be delivered. Except that the napkins are at a completely different station than the silver, they were out of forks, and most of the tables were completely filthy. I watched a busboy randomly swipe the top of a table, sweeping crumbs onto the benches and chairs, then leave an empty drink bottle on the table before wandering listlessly off.  Beverages are (apparently) serve yourself, although they didn't bother to say that when I ordered. I stood at the counter, waiting for iced tea, only to turn around and see that I was expected to get it myself.  If they happen to ""run out of numbers"", then they input your name with your order. Nothing irritates me more than to have my name shouted across a restaurant. Better yet, the waiters wander from table to table looking for their customers.... ""Lisa? Is there a Lisa here?"" while your food cools. Inexcusable.  The only bright point: the croque madame was tasty. Delicious bread, ham, and a perfectly fried egg. But the meager smear of bechamel and a thin slice of cheese were underwhelming. However, the ""side of fruit"" made me angry: a tiny metal creamer with 1 blackberry, a few slices of strawberry, and 2 chunks of  green apple. Insulting.  Fast casual, order at the counter works well when tables are clean and set, and the food delivery is speedy and efficient. Unfortunately this place needs some work in order to make it worth your time."|0
Other than the really great happy hour prices, its hit or miss with this place. More often a miss. :(  The food is less than average, the drinks NOT strong ( at least they are inexpensive) , but the service is truly hit or miss.  I'll pass.|0
Yikes...I won't be going back.  The ordering system is confusing. The staff also seemed confused. The food was very bland and pretty tasteless.  THIS PLACE IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS HONEY BEAR'S NEAR THE AIRPORT!! Skip this bland chain, and go to Honey Bear's!|0
This is my first year participating in Arizona to sell clothing, just wandering how busy its goona be in there ??? little worried, can any one reply me ??|0
Absolutely disgusting.  I had enchiladas and a taco, just to give them a chance.  This was the worst mexican food I've ever had.  Waaaaaay too much government tasting cheese on the food, and hardly any meat.  I do have really high standards because I grew up on Tex-Mex but this was just pathetic......|0
I usually do not complain about bad food but the fish and chips gave my wife a serious case of food poisoning.  So if some manager reads this please check out your fish supply or change the cooking oil.  She never gets sick and has been sick all day (December 29, 2012) from the meal eaten December 28, 2012.|0
"If you have to be some place on time, don't use them.  I called at 2pm for a 4:15 taxi to arrive.  At 4:25 they were calling me saying he was right around the corner, and gave me his location.  Estrella called a couple more times to ""verify my address"".  At 4:35 I called them and cancelled the cab and got a ride from my neighbor.  As we pulled out of my neighborhood, we PASSED the cab. He had taken a street that he thought was going to be a through street and got himself lost. This is a TAXI service, they should know how to get around the valley!!  Don't these people use GPS, or MAPS at least?!?!?!?  End of story, I was still late for my class that I paid 250.00 bucks for. I was not allowed in, and the money is non refundable.  So thanks Estrella wasting my time and costing me money.  WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER."|0
We were so disappointed!  We were on vacation in Scottsdale and wanted to try a Brazilian restaurant.  It was nothing like the one we have had home.  Actually it was completely worse than all three Brazilian steakhouses we have close to home.  I tried about 12 different meats and I think there were only 2 out of the 12 that were tender.  The rest were over cooked or hard as a rock.  We really wanted to love this place as I kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better.  Besides being hard, the meats didn't have much flavor.  The salad bar was okay and I don't know that I would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar.  This is sad that I have to say the highlight or our meal was the fresh bread and salami slice you get at the salad bar.  :(|0
"Nice facilities, nice AC, but two FATAL flaws:  1. Children running around yelling and screaming at all times.  This is a failure of the parents and, more importantly, of the staff who apparently REFUSE to enforce any kind of policies against noise whatsover.  To parents and staff: THIS IS A LIBRARY *NOT* A DAYCARE!!!!!   2.  The ""collection"" here is 90% DVDs and ""Dummies"" books with trashy novels thrown in for good measure."|0
Ugh.  My tip-off should have been the Guy Who Saw Me Reading The Menu and came outside to tell me the food was good.  But I was craving Chinese, I work near the COFCO center, and it was threatening to rain.  I scanned the menu, found Kung Pao chicken, and ordered up.  They told me 5 minutes, and they were accurate.  Price was reasonable.  Waiting area was comfortable and well-decorated.  Food was inedible.   I got the lunch special, which include soup, egg roll, entree and fortune cookie.  I couldn't eat any of it.  The soup (hot and sour) was way too sour.  I felt like I would get acid reflux if I ate it.  I couldn't order the fried rice, because it contains peas (I've learned to ask...childhood trauma).  The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat.  The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat...so much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken.  I watch too many movies.  The egg roll was just gross.  It seemed like the wad of mushy veggies was wrapped in biscuit dough before it was deep-fried.  The fortune cookie was stale, and the fortune was even lame.  I would've done better to get soaking wet and hit up Panda Express.|0
35 minutes... No food. You be the judge.|0
"How very disappointing!  Nello's had a delightful menu with an array of salads, pizzas and sandwiches. Not Jac's. If the new restaurant wants to be a ""pub"", it should have a wider variety of selections. The menu was sad.  Due to dietary restrictions, I asked for a plain garden salad. Lettuce, tomatoes and onions. And it wasn't very fresh either. Sad.  Guess we'll be driving up north to Pima Crossing to visit Nello's."|0
"The location has closed (AGAIN).  Not good if you have prepaid washes or other credits as the business has closed.  Some speculation on other sites is that they have filed for bankruptcy again.  Don't bother stopping by to use their services as the facility is cordoned off and a big sign says ""business closed""."|0
Honestly I don't get it.  I went to Dos Gringos with a good friend of mine last weekend.  I had never been to Phoenix before so I was excited to see what the city had to offer.  After entering Dos Gringos we sat at our table for 21 minutes before a waitress came to our table.  She brought us 2 beers and never came back. After 40 minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously weren't welcomed at Dos Gringos.  So we went up to the bar where I waited for 5 minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends.  What I didn't understand was there were maybe only 20 people there and at least 6 people working.  If I was the owner or manager I would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment.  I will never return and I highly recommend you stay away from Dos Gringos as you will be disappointed.|0
"What a crap airline!  If I could give them zero stars I would.  I flew from Phoenix to Denver to New Orleans.  The check-in people, gate staff and flight attendants were rude and abrupt, the flights ALL left at least 45 minutes late, it was the worst flying experience I've had.  I was fortunate thta my Denver back to Phoenix leg was US Airways...never thought I'd say ""Thank you US Airwarys"" for at least that part of the flight not being a nightmare!  I will never fly United again!"|0
Like watching a train wreck in slow motion will definitely be going somewhere else for bagels from now on disappointing have been going there for years.  The eight day old cream cheese was a nice touch (yuck!)|0
I really wish I had a dagger to stab myself in the face for trying to eating here. Absolutely the WORST PLACE in the entire valley. I would turn around and go ask for my money back but I am to embarrassed to even be seen in the drive through again.   Was on my way home, thought I would give it a shot. I ordered random items; chicken taco and onion rings. The taco was like eating out of a horse trough.. It fell apart immediately and I found myself trying to shovel it into my mouth. After about two bites I realized the meat was questionably chicken. The onion rings were so blah I didn't even touch them.   Please do your self a favor.. Dig in the nearest dumpster for lunch, then go home and pound a bottle of vegetable oil. It sure beats the hell out of this joint. No joke.|0
I went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is. Wrong.  The slow (perhaps retarted) staff with no customer service, alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery. Fuck it...stick to Slices.|0
"I should have taken my own advice and stayed far away from this place. Our most recent visit ended hastily when I was served rotten tuna and got barely a ""sorry"" from the staff. I could smell that the fish had gone horribly, horribly off when the ahi tuna salad was put before me by the waiter, and I'm shocked that the kitchen actually thought they'd get away with sending it out. The waiter disappeared so quickly from my table that I had to go hunt him down to point out the bad smell at my table was coming from the food, and he took my plate back to the kitchen and five minutes later came back to say, ""okay, we all smelled it and there's definitely something wrong there.""  Seriously? You had to go pass it around to confirm that I'm not crazy when you can clearly tell within ten seconds that this is not how raw fish should smell? After all this, their solution was to comp an appetizer, not the salad, and eventually gave me a new salad to go, which I decided not to eat just to be on the safe side.   Look, I'm not scared to eat week old leftovers or sushi at a divey joint and I don't really get freaked out by the cleanliness of restaurants, but this could have been dangerous.  I have absolutely warned off all my coworkers and friends against this place, and now I'm warning all of Yelp. It could have been handled in a way that left me confident that it was just another new restaurant kink, but the awful service made it clear that's not the case and I shudder to think of what new low they'll sink to."|0
I'm never shopping here, I don't wanna shop somewhere where associates think if u can afford it in just goona purchase the bag online then looked at if I could afford it|0
"After a day full of meetings, I gathered the hubster and we headed out to eat some Mexican. I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. ""Hi, are you here for happy hour?"". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe ""lots of product in his hair"" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation ""on the rocks with salt"". My drink, and hubster's water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here aren't complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now the hubster's getting annoyed. It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants, so we're not sure where they are coming from, but they don't stop. Hubster mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and hubster asks for the manager. Hell, he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus we'll call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? That's your solution? He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We weren't after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. Hubster had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok.  This is a never return place for us.  And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant. The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good."|0
The Management Group at this location need to make a better effort to control the number of people jumping theaters.  My experience at this theater was one of the worst that I have ever had.  I will never go back to that theater again.  I felt that it was nothing but a complete money grab.|0
"I have always been a fan of Burlington's deals, however I will not be shopping at this one again. I went to return a belt... pretty simple. Instead, I stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of Burlington buying/putting things on layaway. It took three other staff to help her out. There were no words said to me except ""Hold on"". I was pissed. When the lady was finally done, the employee at the service asked ""what do you want?"" Serious help is needed there!  If you work in the area of ""customer service"" I think you should have some."|0
The service level and attitude of the staff was diabolical, they demonstrated absolutely no interest in our business. Ever since moving to the new premises, things have sucked. I shall not be wasting any more of my time or money here.|0
I have been to a buffet like this before, but I will never go to this particular one again.   The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky. We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill.   The cook doused our dishes with water, quickly cooked the ingredients, and returned them in a new bowl.   There is a selection of crispy wonton bits, rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost. I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan. I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite.   Free-range and refills on beverages.   Sat down to eat, was not impressed. I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting. The bowl of ingredients were all bland, perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling, and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad, The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well. We obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving. Had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me, and changes in selections.   We could have taken the left overs home, but opted to leave them instead.   Suffice to say, I do NOT recommend.|0
This place was the worst place to EVER live! I lived here from Aug 2010 to may 2011, i was always in the office see when the grates would be fixed?? the office always gave me the run around very rude. You would think after the gun shoots, assaults, and car break ins that they would fix the gates but nope and to this day they still aren't fixed. When we moved in they said they would be fixed in a week and they lied.  Also the gym is huge but NONE of the equipment works! living here was SO gross! nothing worked our neighbors are Mexican thugs doing drug cat calling at anything that walks it was gross. I hated living here!    But the worst part was a few weeks ago we get a call from collections saying we owe Scottsdale Springs $300 bucks over 10 months after moving out! I called them up like wtf, and they were SO rude said too bad pay it or your credit score will hurt, we even gave a fowarding address and we NEVER got a letter in the mail about any damages. They claim we never gave them a forwarding address which is bull.   I really hope people read these reviews i would hate to see anyone else scammed by this god awful company!|0
Ok I'm very surprised by the reviews on here. I'm not one to want to write negative  reviews but our food was so bad I couldnt help myself. Maybe this place was having an off night tonight but their pizza barely had any cheese on it and the crust was soggy. Unfortunately the pizza was better than the wings that were overly breaded and soggy as well. Thank God we had a groupon and didn't have to pay full price. Won't be ordering from here again. Disappointing :(|0
"Treachery! Seek it out:  Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F. Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.  P.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a ""gourmet"" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrées right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced.   Once you've paid nearly $14 for their ""orange peel chicken"", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.  Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.  Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's ""i"" so that it would ""fit on the signs better,"" or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great ""American Chinese"" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of ""wok charred beef"", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.  The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:  'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. ""Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant,"" Jim told me, pointing at the statues. ""It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing."" From a Chinese perspective, P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'  Which is just fine, because everything there tastes like death anyway."|0
This location was a Groupon find... Won't be back. The girl behind the counter was nice but even though I had the groupon right in front of me, she had to read it several times and I had to explain to her what I was supposed to be getting with it. The red light therapy is a nice idea... But the room the bed was in was lacking. They should hire an exterminator, not leave sticky bug traps down with dead bugs all over the floor where people generally have bare feet... Yuck!!|0
"And then it all changed...  I think this is my very first review that has been demoted to 1 star after being on the coveted 5 star for a long time.   So, where do I start. After feeling dog sick for a few days, I finally decided to ""walk-in"" to this place because that's what they do now supposedly. They take walk in patients who are seen by the NP. I signed in at 8:20 and was not called in the back until 10:00am. Then I waited another 35 minutes for the NP to come in and see me. By the time everything was over, it was 11:00am before I walked out of this place.   I asked to talk to Brenda, the office manager and was brushed off twice. Supposedly she is going to call me but would not see me when i was there for two and a half hours! I guess she didn't have the balls to face me at that point. What could she have said really?   The front desk lady did a screw up and let another walk in patient go before me even though he came 10 minutes after I had already signed in. When I pointed that out, she said he came before me and I had to show her the sign in chart. Instead of apologizing, she just kept doing what she was busy doing without acknowledging her mistake.   When the NP did come see me, she missed a couple of key things in my chart that she totally should have asked me about. I was quite appalled. I had to point out a deathly allergy that I have even though it should already be in my chart.   My final analysis: In my opinion, don't go here if your health and time are valuable to you."|0
After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 2.5 hour drive to Flagstaff, i thought Wendy's would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the go...well, I was wrong.  * Chicken Nuggets: dry, freezer-burned meat with extra hard double-fried shell.  * French Fries: super hot, crunchy, over-fried french-fry-shaped fry-shells. so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating french-fry chips.  * Junior Bacon Cheese Burger: bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated.  Guess what, last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100+ weather is hot, dry, crunchy, tasteless food!|0
Remember how I said that the Trivia was the best thing about this place?  Well, they got rid of long time Triva host, Dave (who had been featured in the College Times and was the best thing about the trivia).  Without Dave's personality, this place just doesn't cut it.  Will never go here again. Bummer.|0
There are few resources in Arizona for dancers, actors and performers, so it's best to order online if you have the time to wait for shipping. Dee's Dancewear is overpriced and because they know they are the only game in town, their customer service (and return policies) have suffered. In an emergency situation, you're better suited going to Mischa's Dancewear on 33rd Ave and Bell or Capezio's in Scottsdale. Otherwise, order online and steer clear of this establishment when possible.|0
There were 3 cars in the parking lot and people walking to the door but the young lady closed the doors at 9:51pm  The young lady spoke through the glass for atleast 4 minutes explaining she would not open the doors  I live behind this location but I may not return. There is a Walgreens off of 7th Street...|0
"I was really excited to try this restaurant, and tonight my husband and I came and ordered food to take-out. The service was very friendly and the store was clean, cute, and colorful...but the food was very disappointing. My husband ordered the curry chicken, and although it tasted okay, he literally almost choked on tiny bones in the meat 4 or 5 times. I asked ahead of time if they used white meat and was told yes, but the ""Calypso Pasta"" I ordered had tiny, tiny pieces of dark meat jerk chicken...instead of the boneless white strips I was expecting, and really it was just mediocre. I'm bummed I wanted to like this place."|0
I think they need to hire a better chief; the food doesn't taste right.  My mom said she can teach them how to cook for free.|0
"Considering what is considered the 'norm' for workout facilities... this place is WAY behind the times.  This place would be amazing for 1952- it would then be considered clean, tidy, and cutting edge. There are some actual perks about this place- they do have daycare and plenty of mirrors for me to watch my fat jiggle while I run on the treadmill ;)  It's just an utter disaster. When the BF and I originally signed up, we got a couples membership at a newly redone Glendale location and it was worth the monthly membership fee.  This place does not need a 'face-lift.' It needs to be gutted and TOTALLY renovated. You just feel a nasty moistness when you walk in the door- which just gets worse the longer you're there... and is even MORE WORSE during the summer. Guys always have the weight benches dominated. There's never any availability for machines (any kind) from 4-7:30pm, then it starts to thin out. Blah bla bla blah bla.  Considering this is the ""Biltmore"" location... huge disappointment. Fact."|0
Very nice location but food was awful.  Had a chicken salad yuck.  Service stunk big time!|0
"Your reviews are hilarious!!   (shoot--who was this referring to??)  I try to avoid WM.  I'm always warned about the possibility of TB or now, pig flu.  I think the hub just doesn't want to go shopping--not that I LIKE shopping.  I know someone who worked WM in WA and she says the conditions are just horrible for employees.  I've spoken to at least one cashier that is actually FRIENDLY and LOVES his job benefits and bonuses.  He's a minority I guess bc as you all said, YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING and CAN'T GET HELP without attitude, usually.    I'm standing there staring at 2 mgrs, and they just ignore me for a few minutes?  I didn't want to interrupt the conversation, so I waited.  FINALLY, one asks if I need help???  NAAAAAH, I was just admiring your huge body and wondered how long it might take me to look that way.  FOOLS!    On my last visit, a customer said ""excuse me"" to the 3 employees behind me in the aisle.  I glanced at her and she sighed, rolled her eyes and shook her head as they all ignored her.  I chuckled and acknowledged her frustration.  Then one employee pipes up with ""OH, I'm sorry ma'am, can we help you?""  She asks to find an item, the customer thanks them, they say ""You're welcome"", the customer leaves and they sarcastically continue to each other: ""THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.  NO, THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.  We're not here to find stuff for stupid people, we have better things to do.""    That's why, when I walk by an employee working, if they lay eyes on me, they immediately look away and pretend to be engrossed in their job, to avoid stopping to help.  WT?  What's wrong w/this management???    I agree, you can find some deals and save some money, but the attitude is over the top.  There are a FEW employees that actually smile and appear friendly, at least when I see them, and I can point them out.  If not for the more often than not occurences as mentioned above, I stay OUT of WM as much as possible, which is a lot.  I've drastically reduced my trips there, but more importantly, I've cut out a huge chunk of purchasing from WM."|0
We came there on November 5, 2011 and the service was very bad. The worst I have ever seen and we were treated like shit. We came into town from LA and Vegas for the NFL game and seen Mrs. White's cafe on Foodnet Work and knew the food had to be great. The chicken was great, but the customer service was so bad we will never return again.  We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel. Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place. Just because the chicken is good, does not mean you treat people like shit.   We had to remind the staff over six times to get our order. We waited over 40 minutes to get the other 3 pieces of chicken to finish our meal. We don't mind waiting but it was pretty rude when you are watching other peolple are getting their meals when they walked in after us. The Mac and Cheese did not look like everyone else's order- it look like it came out of a box. You can tell it was far from homemade, it cleary was not bake, no crust. The gravy was watered, missing favor. Corn bread was over cooked under salted. The cornbread sure as  hell did not look like everyones else's cornbread. I felt like we received the leftovers.   Truly the worst service we ever received. The place needs to learn how to be respectful and just be nice.|0
"10:30pm on a Saturday night.  My friend and I try our second attempt at sushi for the night (see my review of Pearl for the first).  Place is hopping.  We take a seat at the sushi bar.  The Waitress:  ""Are you girls going to be ordering sushi?"" Me: I have a sushi menu in my hand, ""yes."" Waitress:  ""Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too."" Me: What the fuck, bitch. ""Uh, ok""  Dear Ra Waitress,  I'm sorry if I kept you or any other employess, especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed.  It was completely ok to rush me, even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine.  I was hardly the last customer in there.  There were people all around me ordering sushi, so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me.  If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food?  Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot.  I like Ra for the atmosphere, something you completely ruined.  Thanks for that.     Sincerely, Morgan"|0
I do not like this KFC ...or any really for that matter. Every time I have been here the place is filthy. I know they remolded the place and I have not been since then, so I am not sure if the conditions are the same.  The food is just not good in any way anymore. Not that it was ever great, but you could get some decent chicken and some sides and be content. What the hell have they done to the mac & cheese? It is so gross..the color is just not appealing and the taste is worse. Food at this place has been served under temperature enough times to keep me from returning.|0
"we visited on april 15th and And also Sunday April 22.. I have twice now gone to your restaurant and twice been told that I couldnt use my BOGO coupon. The first time my mother went to pick up our order, she was told we didnt order the right food and we had to order off the main entress. The second time we ordered, I was told that we had to order off of the DINER SELECT menu. I did not have my coupon handy, and when I was able to read it, it says specifically, ""Offer valid for one complimentary Diner Select with the purchase of another entree. Complimentary Diner Select must be of equal or lesser value to purchase entree. Valid entrees include SIGNATURE DISHES, BOWLS, SALADS, DINER SELECTS AND LETTUCE WRAPS."" So why, on two separate occasions were we told conflicting information and not allowed to use the coupon, thus spending a small fortune on food, TWICE?!?!? Your customer service is far from what it used to be and I doubt you will be getting more of our business any time in the near future."|0
Not recommended if you're not white. For me, it's the third time somebody threw out racial slurs at my group. I am beginning to think the place is for rednecks and the like. D&B bowling lanes are better.|0
"UNBELIEVABLE!!  so enraged and appalled!!  i took my 91 yr old mom in to the salon for a mani-pedi.  after the pedicure she had the manicure and she asked for french tips.  the GIRL claims she asked mom if she wanted gel nails -- she's 91, did not understand the gal's ""english"" and can't hear, so i presume she nodded.  after mom paid the charge of $60 and i picked her up (i had another appt.)  she told me about the charge and said she had never paid that much for a mani-pedi.  i called and was told the normal charge is $30 w/$5 added for french and HE said to come back cause it was mistake.  we did and the whole group of technicians said it was mom's fault for saying ""yes"" and would not concede AT ALL -- not in the slightest.  i found that to be awful and mom felt very taken advantage of.  i will NEVER return there and i caution any hearing-impaired customers to not use this business.  TO ME and of course to mom, it was such a slam on the elderly. mom is a visitor from the east coast and at her age does not need to be treated that way.  VERY BAD BUSINESS!!!"|0
"I understand I'm not dude and so I'm not there to state at your ""twin peaks"" however, that being said I am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer I'm over it. So I was never gonna come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time. Fries were soggy and our server disappeared. We all decided were not going back. Just because your a good looking server doesn't give you an excuse for sucking."|0
Absolutely gross-  I'm just going to be bluntly honest- who the F cares what the food tastes like when the place looks like a frickin' dump?  It was so disgustingly dirty inside. Besides food, paper, trash- resting among the carpet- the tables were dirty, the bathroom was out of service and I feared touching anything as I was led to my seat... that's a problem.  I've actually never seen such a messy restaurant before. Let me also say that the restaurant was empty when we arrived, and was filthy when we walked in and was filthy when we left.   Obviously no one that works at this restaurant cares about cleaning up between seatings. There's no excuse for a place to be disgusting like this. It's downright unsanitary. You serve food Valle Luna, you're a business Valle Luna- keep the place clean for heaven's sake.|0
Staff is nice, and that's it. They use very cheap tires that only last for a year.|0
I really don't get why everyone is raving this place.  I've been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito.  The portions are really small for the price that they charge.  There is too much tortilla for the meat.  I think this place is overrated and that there are better places for carne asada in the valley.|0
I had not eaten in about 12 hours since we were at the hospital having a baby... and this pizza STILL tasted horrible.  Barely average fast food quality and taste. Avoid!|0
Angry Bro Bar !  Please go here if you wear size smedium affliction shirts you will love it. The bar is lame. Kid you not there was not five minutes that went by where two people didn't try and fight each other.|0
"Seriously?! With grocery stores like Fresh & Easy, Trader Joe's, and even Safeway around here, I wouldn't go to Whole Foods regularly, for ANYTHING, unless I was a bajillionaire. 1. It's wayyyy overpriced. I'm not sure if there's a Central Market around here as haven't seen one yet, but even that is better than this in terms of price!   We got a few items here, specialty items in bulk foods, for example. The wine and beer bar is cool, but unlike the Whole Foods in Austin, Tx, which was the epitome of awesome, (2) one can't walk around with beverage in hand here. Too bad the rules are so stringent about that, because if I were shopping with a glass of wine, maybe I wouldn't notice the horrendous prices quite so much.  My 3rd complaint is that when we ordered coffees from the coffee stand there, my mocha and my boyfriend's latte tasted like motor oil, after taking forever to be made, and the girl saw me swipe my card but THEN told me she ""didn't have a register person"" and I wasn't able to cancel the transaction....so then we had to go back through the main grocery line again. Grrr.  I left unsatisfied, uncaffeinated, and feeling like I had just wasted ten bucks on coffee that we ended up pouring out.   They get one star for having a wine/beer bar at all, but then I have to take that star away because the bar tender said they sold the most beer and wine of any Whole Foods in existence (I call bs - the one in Austin is twelve times busier and people can shop with their beverage of choice, and they have a bunch of restaurants there too so it's truly an experience - it dazzles). This leaves one star for the supply of bulk and specialty items they carry. We went to Trader Joe's after, got twice as much stuff, and spent half as much money. Sayin'."|0
"My friend kept telling me how good their lunches are... I tried it, but it didn't do anything for me.  The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway, but twice the price.  For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods, I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich.   What I had: Ham, cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with 2 sides of pasta, one was parmesan and the other was macaroni. Maybe it was the panini bread. I think the parmesan pasta was made there, but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there, it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton. It wasn't anything to brag home about.   I found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers, no personality whatsoever. I asked for his suggestion, and his reaction was ""anythings good.""   Normally, when I go to AJ's, I go for their desserts. Their desserts are fabulous and you can get individual servings at a reasonable price.  I can take an assortment home and have them for later.   Our company does use them for their catering and I've had many compliments on their dishes, but pass on the lunches."|0
"Some of my friends brought me here last night and the first thing that came into my mind was that this was a set up for To Catch A Predator. I was ready for Chris Hansen to pop out and grill me with, ""What are you doing here?"" If you feel like Kubrick's Lolita really speaks to you, as in it mirrors your life, then you've found a place to feel comfortable in your pervert skin.  If you're of age to consume alcohol, they've got a bar here. The thing about this bar though is that they're really sloppy about pouring drinks, ie. a Manhattan should not taste like a barber's cleaning solution. The decor and set up of this place really needs a face lift.  A few pluses though... If you're under 21, I could see how this would be appealing. I'll admit that the under-21 clubs that I went to when I was under 21 were fun, but now that I think about them they really suck. It seems like an alright experience if this is your first step into the club/bar world. The DJ's here spin pretty much straight hip-hop which is fine, it's very mainstream though and nasty bumping music.  If you go here you're one of three types of people:  1) You were dragged here by your friends 2) You're under 21 or, 3) Your usual excuse is a heart-felt plea, complete with waterworks, that goes something along the lines of, ""I swear, Officer, I thought she was 18!!!!"""|0
Donuts are really good, if they have any when you get there!!!  Went in on a Tuesday morning at 1030, and they only had a total of 10 donuts. Drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at Dunkin Donuts. Very disappointed!!|0
"I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet....  Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  ""You can't do that.""  ""What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling."" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  ""The owners don't allow it.""  ""They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.""  ""No.  You'll have to put it away.""  Now.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).    A couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.      I'd kind of like the ""Restaurant Impossible"" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over."|0
I went today with three friends for dinner around 6 PM Sunday night. Though it seemed quite busy, I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival. Outside seating, despite a hot Arizona summer, was pretty nice with shade. However, this is where the pleasanties end.  Our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes. No one bothered to offer us drinks, and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers. When our waiter came, he did not even apologize for the wait, and we gave our orders: drinks, appetizers, and pita sandwiches.  The hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly, only twenty minutes later. Both were alright, but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips, and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita. We asked our waiter for extra pita, and he kindly agreed. The entire duration of dinner, it never came.  Refills were also a pain, as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter, and he wouldn't come until ten minutes later.  An hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches. I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour. Half the tables outside already left, including tables that arrived after us, and we were the last ones served. The food was of average quality, and I've been to better with cheaper prices.  Slightly expensive, I can see as justified. But many agree that time is worth much more than money. I had an excessive amount, over an hour and a half, wasted on a decellerating Sunday night. Staff is kind of nice, but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself aren't immediately turned off. I can say for certain that I'm never coming here again, and I'll find myself at better places much closer to home.|0
"I had never been to Rainforest Cafe and I'm glad that I got to try it because I love trying things at least once; however, this will also be my last time going there. We'll start from the beginning:   The atmosphere was nice for the ""jungle"" but it was so loud that I could not hear my wife talking to me. I felt that I had to scream at her to talk. Our waitress was nice but didn't check on us often. We barely understood her either because she speak loud enough. We got our drinks (ten mins later) and my iced tea was good but my wife's chocolate shake was gross. Too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive!! We sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later. Food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and $12!! Jeez, so expensive for something so plain!!! I got onion rings for an extra few dollars (they were okay but worth the extra few $$$). My wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didn't give her more than ten! I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the theme but they are completely over priced!!!! Not worth it at all! The food was mediocre but left me sick that night.   Not as amazing as I thought it would be after seeing it many times in Vegas..."|0
I was really disgusted with this place. I should have known when we walked in on Saturday at 12:30 PM and there was no one (not exagerating)  there.  But we were hungry and hot so we stayed. I wanted shrimp tacos but no shrimp at tacos del MAR...just frozen fish that you need to order 5 minutes ahead because they need to microwave it.   It's breaded and precut...couldn't they at least get the kind that has different shapes and looked like it wasn't completely processed?  The kids had bean burritos which they usually love anywhere but didn't like at all. My husband's chicken burrito tasted like a school cafeteria.  The clincher was that the unsweetened ice tea tasted rancid.  I think they let the tea bags go bad or something.  Gross and how annoying that they  don't have seafood.  Wahoo tacos from La Jolla please come here to AZ!!!|0
"I have have been going to Bosa off and on since they opened. Have a bad experience and stop for a while. Then I tell myself "" It's right down the street why not "" then disappointment again.   1. Went in on a Fri at 630AM for their special curler donuts, that they ONLY do on Fri. Sure enough nothing was prepared. Was informed it would take another 30 min to finish the donuts. Noticeable very, very, very irritated I ordered 2 other donuts instead. Was planning on a dozen, but had to settle for what they had. Well staff made sure to charge me a credit card fee due to my purchase being under $ 5.00. When you don't have what you advertise, you might want to waive the .50 fee. Or you will really piss off that customer. Common sense.  2. Customer service is horrible. See #1.  3. When I get home I have never received the correct dozen donuts I ordered. I don't understand it ???? I'm perplexed ??? I don't think it's anything personal. I just never get the correct dozen. They close the box, I pay and go home. Surprise.  The donuts are OK nothing great and not bad they are donuts. They are convenient and close, but I must remember to pass on Bosa Donuts."|0
Worst, slow service ever....especially with almost no one in the place. Food was average at best and thats being kind. Skip it if you are looking to eat or get a drink.  Just an update: I (as well as a friend who wrote a review of the day) were contacted (I didn't see my message until today oops) and offered refunds and gift certificates. Now this seems all well and fine-I do appreciate them trying to make the most of the situation-but my friend is still waiting for a refund and/or certificate. So we shall see. If I could take away my star for more non-service then I would.|0
"We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness, I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and ""come back and try us again."" He made no effort to ""make things right"" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables."|0
There really isn't much I like about Michael's to begin with - I especially dislike them for using my name and putting on such an inferior showing - but this location was a particular disaster.  Clean up your aisles for goodness sake, I feel claustrophobic with all the crap hanging around - its like the clothing section at K-Mart, but possibly worse.|0
This is the worst Pizza Hut I have ever been to. I was up-charged for something I didn't order. When I asked for it to be corrected it was done wrong again, given the wrong change and had the drive thru door slammed in my face. Asked to speak to the manager and he was extremely hostile. He took my change, receipt and food. After some time I asked for a refund and was told that wasn't possible, too much paperwork. Asked for his supervisors number and was told he was the highest manager, there was no one above him. Right.   I went to the next Pizza Hut and asked for the regional manager number. I left the food at the restaurant because I was no comfortable eating it after he took it back to correct their mistake. Not sure what could have been done to it.  The young girl at the window did get it wrong twice, but the example the store manager gives is piss poor and is the issue. I hope Pizza Hut sees who they have working for them and speaking on their behalf because according to this store manager, Tim, he's the owner and CEO of the company. I highly doubt that.|0
I have never been treated so rudely in a retail establishment ever. I went to the shop with my daughter, her friend and my niece...all young adults. I showed a picture of the project we wanted make to the woman working there and she scoffed at me.  I noticed she was playing Solitaire on her iPad...apparently we interrupted her game. She then proceeded to tell us that she would have to open the door and turn on the air conditioner because her mother, the owner of the store, would be back soon and is extremely allergic to fragrance.  The girls and I had body lotion on, this is the desert for crying out loud, and not one of us had perfume on.  Then the mother arrived, there was a brief conversation behind the curtain and she walk out with a towel over her mouth and nose commenting on having to open the door. Seriously? Unfortunately we had picked out some stuff to buy and I'm sorry that I spent the $68. I could have spent more but the experience was so distasteful that we hurried out. If I knew how to give less than 1 star, I would. It was unbelievable. I empathize with the woman and her allergies, but the situation could have been handled so much better.|0
"Found the doctor via his website and called for an appointment. The ladies that answer the phone are sweet so I felt I made a good choice. I was taken into the room and a sweet girl asked me questions and told me the doctor would be right in. He came in quickly and asked if I would mind if someone that was following him would be present. Fine. The other guy walked in along with a lady (medical assistant maybe). No one introduced either of them. Dr. Racette didn't ask me one question and didn't address any of my concerns. He seemed to even brush off the questions I asked or responded with brusqueness. It was very irritating as a patient to be asking questions about serious topics like skin cancer and feel blown off. He prescribed a cream for me and was walking out the door minutes after seeing me and said he would have someone come in with the script. He never talked to me about how the cream works or what it does. Awful awful. Too top it off, they were supposed to call me with test results. I had to call them and the gal that answered said, ""no one called you with the results yet?: NO!! Will not see this doctor again. Sorry but I actually prefer doctors that care to take the time and actually address my questions and make me feel comfortable, not take 5 minutes to rush me through an appointment."|0
Not only was the music the worst I have ever heard the wait staff was as annoying as ever! Like a wanna be swanky place in a strip mall that smells like fish and plays horrible music. Food was so so but over priced for what it was.|0
What happened to this place?  The first time I went about a year ago, both the food and service were great.  Second time, last May, I ordered the same dish and it was horrible.  Drowning in sauce.  But, at least the service was decent.  Just went a third time and it will be my last.  Both the food and service were horrible.  Went for lunch, sat inside and it wasn't very busy.  Our waiter was totally out of it and only had 4 tables and hardly paid any attention to us and kept forgetting things, like taking our order to start.    Then, even the food runner forgot to bring me half my meal after I asked her for it.  In the meantime, I counted at least 17 staff member hanging out in the kitchen area, which is open, so you can see them and half of them were folding napkins.  My food was not very good and actually made me a little sick.  This is a shame, especially because there aren't many places in Phx that have vegan choices, but for the price you pay, I would expect a lot more.|0
"I play squash racquet's, a sport favored by the east coast ""elites"" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:)   Why they let me play, I'll never know:)  Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)  It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a ""Rodgering"":)  So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)  Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)  When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)  After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than ""regal"" atmosphere:)  They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)  The smell in S&J can only be described as ""extreme humanity""...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)  S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on ""tap"", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or ""boofay"" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.  It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)  S&J provided a table full of taco ""fixin's""...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(  They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground ""creature""...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.  I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, ""beef""...just not very good ""beef"":(  The hot tray holding the ""meat"" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of ""meat"" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(  But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.  I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(  I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(  One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not ""broiled""...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)  Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(  Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)  Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).  They say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)"|0
This place was messy and loud.  The food really wasn't great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together.  Overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food.  I will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me|0
IHOP is barely a step up from Denny's in terms of boring chain food. Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there, and it tasted like squishy, mushy cardboard. The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customers.  The reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good. I don't mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily. The coffee is almost bad, but the waitresses always look happy.  [update April 2, 2011]  Why'd I go back? I hate this place now. We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast. I was excited to do this and was eager. I should've stayed home.  My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold, tasted like cardboard, and was crunchy. The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt, crispy and did not look like bacon at all.  My sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold. I sent it back and complained. I think she microwaved my plate.   Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee. She said they had Mocha, Vanilla, or Hazelnut. I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one... she said yes, and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad I'm not allergic!!)  Ok now it's three hours later. My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts, I've been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didn't lay down, she would puke. Seriously.  The management (district managers) really need to care enough to read YELP.  They remodeled the outside of this place and, I guess, spent all their money to make it look pretty so we'd forget they serve dogfood.|0
"Sadly, I'm giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star.  The Manger/operator guy.  Sure, the food here isn't all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive, don't seem to be meth addicted, and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often, and I know why.  My beef is not with the crew members, oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy, the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now.  This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually, one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon, this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order, give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously, what is it, 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order, cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu, they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said ""sorry""  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then, was probably tired of that guys shit.  I don't blame you.  Last trip here, they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last, I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip, and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat, I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order, ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order, says ""This is your order, this is what you have"" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me, the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand, gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that, even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him, puts his hand in front of the guys face, and says ""ssssshhhhhh"" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening, he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog, what does that cost you anyway, about 12 cents in batter, a stick, and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?    Dude (cashier guy, tattoo on your arm), tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job.  No one deserves that shit.  I am actually ashamed I didn't say something for you, I truly am.  What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is.  My rant speaks for itself.  One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him.  For the ones working there, I will pray for you.  You need it.  P.J.L., get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana, they need midget controlling assholes over there.  You would do great at that."|0
"New N. Scottsdale location, Baaaaaaad!  The were 10 staff members milling around and there was no manager on sight.  $10.00 for a mediocre burger, with an uncooked, tasteless bun not large enough to encompass all the arugula.  They forgot the sauce, which apparently is the main ingredient.  The upgrades are ridiculous.  $1.00 here for cheese on an already ""well priced"" burger (btw Flemings blue cheese/bacon burger $6, best in town), $5,00 here for fries.  C'mon.  And, it's the same two hispanic guys, who don't have any idea about chef inspired food, cooking in the kitchen as every other restaurant, there is no chef For the price, you want to see the chef/owner representing, especially at a new location, and, you want competent staff who treats you as #1, and not their conversing with the other staff members as #1, and you want to enjoy what is supposed to be one of the best burgers in town!  What a disappointment.  The lack of top down management care and supervision carries through in all elements of the poor experience.  Take a pass."|0
"I've been to Milano's Music several times and each experience is worse than the first time.  I look at the reviews of people I actually know and realize that each experience is different.  On the biggest day of the year for Small Business owners who should be reaching out to the customers and gladly sell them the smallest items Milano misses that point, by miles.  My husband is re-learning to play the drums and needed a drummer's throne and since it was November 24th and ""Small Business Saturday"" I thought ""why not give them another try"", guess what we walked out with Nothing they lost potential set of drum customer  ( those can cost anywhere from a few $100 to $1k ).  I won't go back in there.  The guy that is in charge of the drum section is rude and pompous and walked away from us TWICE.  The second time was enough to make my blood boil.  We found a throne in another section that my husband liked and I said let's get it.  The guy came over and said ""Oh, I have another one in the box"" and grabbed the one in my husband hands and walked off never to be seen again.  We waited and waited at the checkout counter for him to show up, he never did because he had decided to help another couple.  I looked at the cashier and my husband and said ""NOT cool at all"" and my husband set all the other items he was going to purchase down and said we won't be purchasing anything.    I felt bad for the guy at the register because it wasn't his fault and he apologized but that doesn't give the guy running a section the right to decide what customer is more important and that is what he did.  New customers should never be treated any differently and to basically make a statement of you are not important enough was the final straw.    I grew up around Milano's music stores they were the first  to give me guitar lessons and it is sad to see this happy.  Besides this Yelp review , I plan to write their the store personally.  When small businesses are struggling and this kind of thing happens  a person begins to understand why more people shop with a big box store and less and less from Mom and pop stores."|0
"HA HAHAHAHAHA!  ""Pit"" is right.... man, this place would have been a terrible idea if i wasn't already expecting lameness. now occupying the space that has seen the death of not one, but two dance club (411 and Level), Peach Pit Afterdark.... I mean Cherry Lounge and Pit is beyond ghetto. opened by the same people who do sugar daddy's and dos gringos, this place has all the sexiness and allure of a Trails commercial. You know? I was half expecting to turn a corner to see a neon colored bikini-clad bleached blonde on top of a motor boat. well, they've updated the look of the cage-trapped go-go dancers to mini panties with knee-high dragon rider boots with fuzzy muppet skins adorning them.  the vids of drunken lounge-goers (a la daddy's and now dos) playing in tiny screens on the walls in hallways and behind bars in tact, interspersed with footage of seriously hagard looking chics doing ""sexy"" things like sucking on lollipops, cherries, winking (yes, she was winking right at you, wasn't she? inviting you in to her red-drenched lair to bask in the glow of a alcohol doused club circa 1992).  i'm not sure what the DRESS CODE we were so violently and largely reminded of in line, but the girl in front of me had on an oversized T-shirt, baggy jeans and flip flops (?) and they took her $5 and let her in no problem. i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundy...no joke, spandex black calf leggings, long spandwex shirt in orange, heels and a giant boob belt. it was so incredible i took a picture. she was not impressed with my observation, so i had to sneak the photo.  anyway.... take it for what it is, a club owned by dos gringos guys on mill ave."|0
"I have been a ""regular"" customer at this salon ever since it opened.  At first it was great!  Clean, relaxing, and welcoming.   After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.  She paid attention to detail and didn't rush through the whole process.  I didn't have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ...   The guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.  I didn't notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off, revealing it.  Tracy was doing someone else's nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.    I was shocked that she didn't tell him to at least put his gloves back on.  The ""massage"" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.  Definitely not worth the $25.   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I don't get an infection.  This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received. Even though I had a great gel manicure here, my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back."|0
Living in this area I frequent Desert Ridge a lot, and have been to this Macaroni Grill several times... their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times... My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact. Of course, no one asked if we had been helped, until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us.   Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 15 minutes for our server to come to our table, and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server. I know several people saw us just sitting there, the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not.   This last experience, was about a year after the last. I thought maybe they would have changed. I most definitely thought wrong! We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time. However, our food took FOREVER! Literally, it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta. I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me (you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room). The server never apologized nor did she come and tell us what the hold up was.   Overall, I will never go to that restaurant again.|0
"I have nothing more to add, but I don't want anyone to think 'only a few' people had  complaints about this poorly planned ""festival.""   Oh, wait, I do.   I was there with my 4 year old grand-daughter (and my daughter), since there were going to be kids attractions as well as the food trucks. I thought it was nuts that 3 minutes of jumping around cost $3. But I guess it was consistent with the $4 water and $7 beers.  And it would help if there was some roadway controls and/or temporary signage. By 11am, traffic backed up (down) Pima from the event to Indian Bend and over towards the 101. Cars were skipping ahead and cutting into line, further delaying entrance.   If success is measured by interest, the festival was a success. If by performance and customer satisfaction, not so much. And how can a vendor commit to showing and not have enough food to feed the presold ticket holders? Why risk your hard-fought reputation?"|0
Bad food, but lots of it.  If you have a hangover and need grease, this is your place.  Other than that, drive a block and eat at Mucho Gusto down the street--now that is real mexican food!|0
A friend was visiting from out of town and we decided we wanted a pampering experience.  So, rather than go to my neighborhood mani/pedi place, we went over to old town scottsdale for lunch and a (we hoped) luxurious pedicure.  This place looked very promising, and the lady at the front really talked them up, so we took the plunge.    Everything seemed promising . . . we waited in a lovely outdoor area until they were ready for us.  Then . . . disappointment.  The pedicure was nothing I couldn't get for half the price, the massage chairs just vibrated, my feet were still a little rough afterward, and the paint job wasn't even that good.    Basically, this was VERY overpriced for what was an incredibly unexceptional pedicure.  We still enjoyed ourselves, but agreed we would never go back there.|0
"I really wanted to like this place.  For starters, I paid cash for my take out. I was owed back five dollars and was told "" we don't have enough change"". So I had to settle for $2.50. What kind of restaurant doesn't have proper change?  Especially on a Saturday night.        The food:  Chicken lettuce wraps had a strange fishy taste. Gave up on them after a few bites.  Vegetable chow mein:  In my opinion, a broun sauce is thick and flavorful. This one was very liquidy and flavorless.  Dumplings were edible at best.       Do yourself a favor and stick with China Chili."|0
Not worth comin here. I'm all for food like this but this restaurant sucks. They gave me and my dad the wrong meal, and the food was not that good. The meat was dry and the rice was cold. Not worth it.|0
"My g/f love sushi! She made me a connosiuer of it. and I have to be critical. So many college kids ""love"" RA, but it's mediocre at best.  I'll just list a few things that irk me: I went during a happy hour with co-workers. It was PACKED. Good thing, right? WRONG! Extremely poor service. when I went in to meet coworkers who already had a table the hostess told me I have to wait. When I said I have a table, she got in my face. I was tired, long-day and I wanted to chill. I walked past her, found my friends, and she left me alone. The waitress took quite a bit of time to get around to my table, and the sushi servings were OBVIOUSLY LOW! I went to Zen 32, and now my choice is SakeBomber. their happy hour servings are much more than RA, and their prices are BETTER!  Be ready for loud noises, as every one is trying to talk louder than the music, and the person next to them.  Just an overall poor experience. and I tip on service.   Food quality was so-so. Just don't go during a happy hour, which is the only time it's worth it because it's priced so high."|0
"One star for the most terrible service in recent memory.  Our server ""DK"" was outright rude and horrible, and outright ignored us when she wasn't making us uncomfortable.   As a former waitress of 14 years, I have the utmost respect, patience and tolerance for my former bretheren - but this woman needs to go.  BAD DK!  Otherwise, our Teppiniyaki (sp?) chef was wonderful, the food was delicious and fresh and a solid four stars.  I have been going to Kyoto since 1995 and it remains a fun and festive place with very reasonable prices.  Too bad it was ruined this time by DK!   DK needs a different job, more suited to her personallity, like euthanizing kittens or something."|0
"ok, let me be straight with you. i hate paying full price for anything. yes, i'm one of those people. i love a coupon. i love a discount. and i absolutely love a bargain! but i don't like to feel dirty when i leave a store. i felt really, really dirty when i left this store. ewwwwww. this is a yucky ross. dirty, dirty, dirty! the floors and clothing racks were filthy. i couldn't have bought something even if i wanted to because the store was so gross - i got black ""stuff"" on my hand after touching a clothing rack. the floor was so discolored i'm not sure what the original color was. parts of the store's floor were sticky. many of the clothes had indistinguishable marks on them, presumably from the dirty hangars and racks they are stored on. selection was meager, there wasn't a single shoe, bag, wallet, sock or home decor item that caught my eye. the trip was a waste of an hour that i'll never get back. never, ever again."|0
"Really, if I could, I would give this place zero stars, because it is a disgrace. If you need an emergency vet in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area, go to Sonora Veterinary Specialists on Cactus/40th St.(http://www.sonoraveterinaryspecialists.com/). It's also 24/7, but unlike VCA PVEAH, it is a truly valuable, legitimate facility, and it''s staffed by engaged, committed, deeply caring, and extremely knowledgeable and skilled personnel. At SVS, you and your pet are treated well and what you pay is fair and justified.  VCA is the opposite of SVS in every single way. VCA is, in fact, the WORST of corporate animal service providers. The space is small, cheap, cramped, and the staff are indifferent at best and don't convey any genuine love of or concern about animals in pain or distress. All they want is your money. They do NOTHING for the $99.75 they charge for an ""emergency exam."" We essentially paid that amount just to be given an astronomical estimate, literally nothing more--our dog was the exact same bloody, traumatized mess we gave to them when they gave him back--after making us wait nearly an hour without ANY communication).  Furthermore, they tack on bogus surcharges ($5.25 for a ""biohazard waste fee"") that are irrelevant to the ""service"" provided, and their drug prices are absurd--$8 for a single Tramadol tablet, anyone?  Conversely, our (and our dog's) experience at Sonora Veterinary Specialists was wonderful (even in the context of an emergency), and the cost was ultimately significantly less.  VCA is a money-grubbing, depressing, sham."|0
"OMG! I am so frustrated at this store, I have never met such an incompetent group of people in my entire shopping life.   First, I called Fry's Electronics to check to see if they had a specific GPS model that worked in Europe. I called because I live at 115th Ave and Buckeye which is about 20miles from the nearest store. The call center informed me they did not carry that model but listed about 10 other GPS with maps of Europe. I asked again those models have maps of Europe? ""Yes and Australia too"". And you have those models in stock? ""Yes."" What is the price range? ""$100 to $300"". Thank you. FIRST MISINFORMATION!   So I drove to  30th Ave and Thunderbird, talked with ""GPS Specialist"" (which apparently means nothing) and he (Jared) informed me they did not have any GPS units with European maps!! He said the call center ""is a bunch of retards"" and that those were all last years models.   Then he called someone and looked at several GPS Units. When he did not know  if the unit had European maps or not he GOOGLED them! (okay not confident in your product knowledge). Then he sold me a $260 unit with European maps. SECOND MISINFORMATION.   I drove all the way home and the GPS did not have European maps! I had to buy them for another $100 which I could have done with a cheaper GPS.  So I drive back to Fry's. Speak with a Supervisor, they return my first GPS. I speak with the same sales rep (ya thats great). He says he figured out 25min after I left that he sold me the wrong product and none of their GPS have european maps.   So I then buy the cheapest model that was could download European maps, according the the sales rep Garmin NUVI 50Lm for $129.  THIRD MISINFORMATION. Because according to the Garmin site the NUVI 40Lm is also compatible and cheaper.   I then went home bought the $100 European map and couldn't download it to my GPS because there wasn't enough space available!!!  Now I have to buy a miniSD Card and a miniSD reader for my Mac book. Awesome. Great to know that the electronic store knows nothing about electronics!"|0
I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes (two weeks) although these fools canceled my financial aid. I will sue this school if they even attempt to collect money from me and I have withdrawn from the classes on the right time, but this rep. told me that the withdrawal period was Jan. 11.|0
Dr. Pierrend is ok, he will write prescriptions for about anything without really investigating if the are needed but he seems like a nice guy. The staff are horrible. They tried to charge me 2 times for lab results which are covered by my insurance. Refused to give me the results without billing insurance for an office visit. I would not recommend this medical provider to anyone. Everyone in my family has gone to PMG and has a bad story to tell. If you are smart you will look elsewhere for medical help|0
Simply stated..............a GREASY burger from start to finish..  NOT 4 me....This place I will avoid while I continue on to a real good burger joint.!!|0
"Horrible experience. We had a home emergency which forced us to move out for 15 days. We referred to them by a friend. We explained to them we're Seniors on limited income but assured them they'd be paid in full. We paid the medical and our insurance co verbally told them that once the bill was submitted they would be paid.  But, No, No, NO!!!!  ""Not our policy""  They were holding our two kids for ransom!!!  Horrible, uncaring staff to deal with."|0
"Not a fan.  I was in the Biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats.  As I picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats, my total came to be about $3.00.  I did not have any cash on me so I took out my ""plastic money"" the debt card and they wouldn't take it telling me that I needed to buy a few more things because they have a $5.00 minimum.  What store has a minimum nowadays???    The customer service was also very lack luster.  The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying.   Needless to say a store that I used to like, I will no longer be back.  There are so many other great dog stores..."|0
The food was okay but the portion sizes where the smallest I have ever seen....and I am a regular to fox restaurants.    Babbo is much better.|0
"Needs a new name - now.    The Pischke's of old had such a sad ending.  I appreciated McGrath's effort to keep ""Pischke's"" alive.  But it is nothing, nothing, nothing like the Pischke's of old.  Call it ""The Blue Ribbon Cafe"" - take out the PIschke name - I can't imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.    The current restaurant is not a laid back, family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious, and the food matches that."|0
Horrible service. Twice now I've gone there and they keep messing up my drink. I work for Starbucks!! It's not hard to get a drink right! Believe me. Horrible service. The people that work there All have bad attitude. One lady doesn't even look at you when your ordering your drink. I think that someone needs to go In there and fix it and make it a welcoming Starbucks that it's known for. Ya a few of the employees that work there are absolutely wonderful but when you get that one that is just rude it just makes you not want to go there anymore. I stopped going. They still get my drink wrong when my mom goes to get coffee. Horrible.|0
It's been a few months since I've been here, and what a change, not for the better. I usually get the same thing to start with, ceviche and pollo asado. Both are usually quite delicious, not this time.  The ceviche had absolutely no flavor to it. As if the chef tried to make it as flavorless as possible. I did not finish it as it was not enjoyable in the least. Now for the tacos. Stale taco shells, dried and overcooked chicken, slopped on guac and no pico de gallo. The tacos were so bad I tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo, since they did not put any on, and then I was charged $1.00 extra. Of course, no manager was anywhere in sight. This place simply doesn't care. On the bright side, the margaritas and salsa are still good, but the chips were stale.  Not only will I not return, but I can no longer recommend this place to businessmen from out of town. I see dozens of new business people every day who stay in Scottsdale and they always ask for Mexican food, and I've always said Cien Agaves. No more.|0
Service was horrible and food was mediocre at best~ won't be going back|0
"I am not a fan of this place. I like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the proverbial ""positive sandwich""  Top Bun: The location is fantastic. I really like where it is, its a cute little place that is very easy to find.  The Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd. I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn't good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn't try it.   Lettuce, onions pickles, tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesn't work there anymore, luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes  Bottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client. I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things. I personally have not had a good experience with this place, but I respect the fact that a majority of the reviewers for it have."|0
1 star for service, but the food is not ok :( they literally put 4 pieces of chicken on my taco. I let that go & figured was a mistake. When I went again, ordered different item & same result. Little to no meat. I will not be going back.|0
No, I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile.  A coworker recommended this place to me. Actually, two coworkers did. However, upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it, I noticed that there was mold in it.  Yes, mold.  Sorry Miracle Mile, your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent, I can't forgive mold in a pie. I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.  Who knows if I will get my 2.95 for moldy pie back.  *ETA MM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95. I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive.|0
They added broasted chicken to their menu... I love me some broasted chicken, so in I went to investigate.  I do not love me THEIR broasted chicken.  To me it tasted rubbery and had a strange odor, and it was so salty that an hour later I could still taste it. I ordered a few pieces and I ate part of one and then bolted.  I can't speak to anything else on the menu. Their garlic knots, for what it's worth, were fine.|0
Gross, repulsive, appauling, disgusting, overrated, dirty, should be shut down by the CDC.  You get the jist?|0
I took my kitty to the Beat the Heat low cost spay event and she came home with a hematoma in her ear that was NOT there when I took her there in the morning. Surprise, surprise...they can recommend a vet to take her to. I'm pretty mad about this.|0
Empty tables. Told 15 minute wait. Ok. 5 minutes into wait (by the door, bumping elbows with counter patrons), 2 people at the counter complained they had been there 20 minutes. We left at that point|0
"We went here for a family dinner.  Our family is loud and boisterous but not obnoxious.  We asked to be seated in the bar since some of us wanted to watch the game.  No problems so far.  Our waiter was really nice at first, but seemed flustered and as if he wasn't getting the help he needed to keep up with his tables.  I waited tables for 12 years and this guy was nearly literally scrambling to keep up, a sure sign of not enough help or lack of teamwork.  Of the two hostesses, ONE of them could have bothered to help him out by refilling water, tea and soda for us, but alas they did nothing.  We waited so long for drink refills that my husband got up and saw a pitcher of coke on the bar, so he poured himself a glass, which he was scolded for!  I could not believe it, I was shocked.  A guest should NEVER be treated this way.  If anything, someone should have apologized to my husband for not giving us what we needed for the meal.   The chips were good, and they kept them coming, so props to them for that.  They are served with bean dip and salsa.  I liked the salsa a lot, not spicy enough for me, but a good amount and mixture of yummy stuff, including cilantro which I find many ""salsas"" don't even contain!  To me, it is not salsa without cilantro.  The teensy bowls of salsa they bring though need some rethinking.  They should either bring one per person or consider a bigger size.  It's only about 2 Tablespoons, and that aint much salsa (beware, some sides of rice and beans also come in these super tiny containers - three or four bites and it's gone)!  Anyhow, we ate tons of chips and salsa because the food took SO long to come out.  Our waiter sort of apologized for this by keeping us updated that it was actually coming.....someday.  Our food came out a good 35-40 minutes after we ordered.  Sadly, two meals were completely missing in action and the two of us that ordered fajitas (which came out of the kitchen very cool, not even the slightest bit of heat from the iron skillet or the meat) had to wait at least 10 minutes for their tortillas, so they couldn't even eat what was at the table, which was getting cold.  After the two missing meals came out, one was the wrong meat, red meat instead of chicken.  More waiting...the table eats, minus one.  When everyone is nearly finished, the right chicken taco dish comes out.  It was delicious, but overpriced.  The chicken was nicely grilled and the tacos were served the way I like them, with a little bit of onions, more cilantro, lettuce, lime and pico de gallo.  They also came with cheese, but I don't like cheese on tacos.  They came on tiny little corn tortillas, which themselves were good, but way too small to make decent tacos that didn't fall apart.  Plus, I ran out of  the tortillas before my meat and other stuff was gone.  Our waiter was really nice except for the scolding (I'm still floored by that), so I can't decide if he sucked or the place sucks, or maybe they both do...We definately won't be back."|0
I have so many friends that love this chain, but I'm not a fan. I've eaten at different locations across different states, but always end up sick. I think that I must be allergic to a seasoning that they apply to everything. I've gotten sick from salad, pasta, to steaks. Needless to say, if a friend wants to eat dinner here, it's tea or water only for me.|0
We use to visit this Pub 10 years ago because they had a nice English waitress and excellent fish and chips for the price.  However, we went back a few weeks ago and boy were we disappointed.  The price of the fish and chip dinner went up and they cut the portion in half.  No one assisted us in putting two tables together, we had to do it ourselves.  Two guests wanted a good English hot tea and they didn't brew it in advance, it was just thrown into a small metal tea pot and we had to ask for cream and sugar.  So we've decided there are newer and better places to eat fish and chips, especially up in north Phoenix.|0
Worse pizza I have had in a while. We ordered 3 slices and they tasted like they had been sitting out for a while and nuked. Crappy service too. Salad was plain and all oil no vinegar for dressing. . Service half ass. I am surprised they have remained in business fo several years. Also they apparantly have no AC it was VERY warm inside even on a slightly chilly day in Nov so we sat outside the inside was so hot and stuffy. this place totally sucks.|0
Not good. And it's not been for a couple of years. There are advantages: good location, rarely busy, good for larger groups. But last few times we've been there have experienced average food and lousy service.  When joining my already seated group on Saturday (3/28) the high-school hostess wagged her finger in my face like an East German border guard, the waffle house waitress poked me in the shoulder to get my attention and the wife's chicken dish had to be sent back as there were only 2 measly pieces of chicken in it.  Only 2 beers on tap. Garbage.|0
Hands down, the single worst public mass transit system I have seen ANY PLACE I have ever lived or traveled to (and I am an avid world traveler).  I've been riding this system on and off (I vaccilate between non-Phoenix-metro cities and here a lot) for roughly 10 years, and yeah, for a few of those years I would also drive a car here and there, so I have a sound basis of comparison.   This is a joke compared to other cities in the USA (and abroad) that have equivalent populations. Hell, in NYC and LA, it's SOOO much easier to get around even though those places are larger and more densely populated. Phoenix is easily 30 years behind every other city-size comparable mass transit system that's out there. Get with the times!  We need: busses that run MORE than once per 1/2 hour (and that's at it's current fastest), busses that are ON TIME (DAILY, they are never on time. Always way too early without waiting, or way too late without apology), more stops, stops that have actual BENCHES or SHADE or POSTED INFORMATION of any kind. I cannot even imagine how travelers get around on this thing, nothing is ever posted with any relevant info or signage.  Etc, etc, etc. But seriously, just god awful and a complete joke to anyone who has ever experienced public transport anywhere else.|0
Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.   It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.  When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.  Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something.|0
This place has really bad service and the food is barely decent, I would advise not to dine here. There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix.|0
"I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday morning and was actually the very first guest.  I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated.  The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing .  I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree.  When my salmon dish came out I said to my self ""WHAT in the hell?"" Two extremely thin slices of salmon, little salad, and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side.  Salmons cheap and they charged me $15 for this crap?  I work in the food industry and the food was crap.  Next, the entree.  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.  Explaining to me how delicious this special was.  So I took his advice and ordered.  When the dish came out I said to my self again ""What in the HELL?""  Four small scallops, 2 baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce.  The scallops weren't seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $32 for crap.  The meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again.  I could of gotten some pho for $8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasn't even mediocre."|0
"I only ask for two things when I'm flying. To land safely. And to not fear planes while on them.  US Airways only delivered on one of those, and I'm still undecided on the first one. Took a flight late from PHX to SFO. Two hours isn't too bad. Unless of course it was the longest two hours of your life and you could hear people in the cabin praying for their lives. I understand that turbulence is normal. But I would rather you cancel another flight because it is too dangerous to fly, then to put passengers through the scariest flight of their lives. Oh and when you finally do land and are thanking your maker that you are in fact still alive, its probably best that you don't have to overhear the pilots saying ""Wow, that was scary. I'm surprised we landed alright."" Morons. They should pay for the trauma I'll have for the rest of my life."|0
HORRIBLE service - did nothing to correct our experience.  On July 7, 2011, my date  and I arrived around 6:30 pm, well dressed and ready to enjoy a celebratory dinner without any financial limitations. We would have easily spent $250+.  Instead, after an hour of being seated  to review our menus we were never offered more than a cocktail.  Tables around us were receiving quality attention by other servers...complete with the run down of the specials, house favorites, answering questions, etc. We, on the other hand, were lucky to have our make server look at us, much less take us to the next step our level in our dining experience.  When the table behind us, seated a good 15 mins after us, received bread before we were, my date and I decided that was our tipping point and would not stay any longer.  When our server came to ask if we were ready to order we informed him  we would not be staying for dinner  and would like the bill for the cocktail.  Never once did the server apologize, offer what he could do to make things right, etc.   Needless to say, we were stunned. The hostess thanked us for dining on our way out...again, we both gritted our teeth with frustration. However, later we discovered that after an hour of sitting in the dining room, we were there long enough to enjoy a meal. It's unfortunate we never got the opportunity to, however.  What did go right was...we were promptly seated and the cocktail server provided decent service.|0
Prices are often way too high!|0
"I just finished my G & S meal that I ordered to-go; actually, I just finished throwing it out. It was HORRIBLE. And by horrible, I mean shamefully bad. And by shamefully bad, I mean, heinous! I had a very disappointing experience here about a year ago but I thought I would give it another try. I should have proceeded with caution when I asked the long-term employees at the neighboring Blockbuster what was good and to the person, they all stammered and failed to reply. Seriously, zero out of four could give me one ""great"" dish! I've lived in both Mpls & Chicago and my Ex used to travel the Orient and we were always surprised at how POOR the quality of Asian food was in this area and WHY the people here, seemed to like it!? It's absolutely baffling! I had the Orange Beef & Spring Rolls. The Orange Beef looked scarey right in the container. But when i ate it - UGH! The texture was all off and the sauce..... it had these big, clear, GELATINOUS, ..... ugh ugh ugh! I can't even talk about it. Like biting into a ball of corn-starchy orange extract! I'm still sick from those few bites! [Truly.] And while I ordered vegetable spring rolls, I got what tasted like low-quality hamburger meat! In fact I finally identified the flavor and texture as: SAUSAGE! It was like an Asian Spring Roll with chunks of Italian Sausage inside!! How's that for a combo? Ugh...... [stomach turning] I'm sorry, I'm a Single Parent and I'm usually grateful to have someone cook for me. Grateful even when i am paying. But during ""tough times"" when i actually ""treat"" myself and then plunk down $20(!!) for unedible... yuck - it's totally, TOTALLY unacceptable!  Shame on you, George, for offering such little quality control and not aspiring to a higher standard overall. No wonder the place was (not) hopping on a Saturday night! Simply one of the worst meals EVER."|0
We had read good things about Over Easy, and were excited to try it out. We went a few days after Christmas, and were horribly disappointed.  When we walked in, we were seated by one server. Then, a few minutes later, another host came up to us and asked why we stole a table and did we not understand how seating works? We were quite confused and offended, as we were seated properly and had done nothing wrong.  Then, once we ordered, we waited over 45 minutes for our food. Finally, we asked about it, and then it was out within a few minutes. They had completely lost our order.  When our food arrived, one dish (the Over Easy -- toasted brioche with spinach & an egg) was absolutely inedible. The brioche was so burnt that we could barely cut it, as was the bacon. The fried egg was very undercooked, even though we requested it completely cooked through. I was honestly shocked the server brought us the dish without saying anything, since it was clearly burnt.  The other 2 dishes (banana & pecan french toast, and the Loretta sandwich) were just alright -- certainly nothing to rave about. And, the 3 of us ended up splitting these 2 dishes, since the other dish was awful. We ended up leaving early because we were all so disappointed. At which point, our server asked if we'd like a box for our uneaten burnt brioche. It would have been much more appropriate for her to ask if there was something wrong with it, since it was obviously not eaten.  Anyway, I'm not sure if we just caught them on a bad day, but I would never go back again or recommend Over Easy to anyone else.|0
I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I went there looking for a gift.  I received no help.  The girl was too busy helping the wives of the baseball players.  I guess you need a large bank account to receive help in this store. Also, they did not have a very good selection of items. I think I will take my business to other stores who care about their customers.|0
I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight.  The lobby, salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept.  To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce.  I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!|0
"I'm a little shocked how high this place is rated, to be honest.  I'm not disappointed easily, but I've given this place three chances to impress and they've consistently disappointed.   I live nearby and was very excited for a new, trendy place to eat & drink. The first time we went there, we sat at the ""outside"" bar. The male bartender was not personable at all-he was actually quite rude. When I politely asked him if he knew the price of a liquor off the top of his head (and not to worry about it if he didn't, I was just curious), he snottily replied with, ""well, there's not a button for it so I don't know."" He then rolled his eyes and walked away. I was astounded at how rude he was but shrugged it off. I actually felt bad because I thought somehow I offended or embarrassed him because he didn't know the price of this particular liquor, so I apologized to him, and he proceeded to made another smart comment about how he charged me the well price but that the next time I come in it might be much higher, again being very snotty and rude. My boyfriend was actually pretty upset at the way he spoke to me but chose to let it go because we just aren't the type if people to be confrontational or to complain.  After our meal and about an hour before close, he told us he was leaving and that another girl would be taking care of us. When she showed up all she did was clean the bar in preparation to close (even though that wasn't for another hour) and didn't even introduce herself or say hello. I waited for her to notice that my boyfriend's Blue Moon was empty but she was too busy cleaning so I asked her myself. She asked me what beer he was drinking, I told her, then watched her pour the wrong beer and give it to me as if I wouldn't notice. (Not all alcohol is available at that side of the bar. For instance Blue Moon and the liquor I was drinking are stored at the main bar, another point of annoyance for the original, rude male bartender. But how is that my fault? I didn't know that.  And clearly this girl didn't feel like going to the other bar to pour the correct beer for my boyfriend, even though she specifically asked me which beer he was drinking and then lazily poured whatever wheat beer they had in tap at the bar we were sitting at.) That was the ""straw that broke the camel's back"" for me. We paid out and went to Darcy McGees (in the same shopping center) where the staff are always pleasant and helpful.  We have since given the Lion two more tries but been severely disappointed with the service. The food is excellent- but just cannot make up for the terrible service. The second time we tried this place we sat at the main bar (as to not inconvenience the bartender at the outside bar), and all of the bartenders were too busy talking amongst themselves to notice that both of us were empty on drinks and hungry with no menus offered to us. I'm sorry to say that we won't be giving this place another shot."|0
"After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years, I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands. It was an issue of ""protecting the thumbs."" When I told her I didn't like forearms and elbows, she explained that she'd never worked without using her forearms (and, I assume, her elbows, too). After just five minutes, when I asked for more pressure, she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasn't the ""therapist for [me]."" She was right. What are they teaching these people these days, and why doesn't an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff? I won't offer her name, but, if considering a massage at this establishment, I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money."|0
Our family made the mistake of dining here on Thanksgiving. Everything from the table to the food to the clueless and absent waiter was outright below average and certainly no where near the kind of restaurant described in the other reviews (which I wonder now if were written by the owner or manager). What a disappointing holiday.|0
"Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.  After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the ""OPEN"" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected ""Butai"").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said ""We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..."" and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...    When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.    I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.    Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning."|0
Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!|0
Really as bad as it gets. Crap food. Over priced. Ugly, tasteless interior Bad music and music system Tired staff This place needs to either have a complete redo or it needs to close.  I would rather go down the street and eat at Applebee's, and I have never been to an Applebee's. Too many other choices now in the neighborhood for this place to go on in its present condition. Then again, there might be enough people around these parts with really bad taste to keep the place going.|0
I'd have to disagree with the person who said this restaurant is dog friendly.  I was told off by the owner because I had a little dog outside table and that was right after I finished paying for an overpriced breakfast dish and coffee.  I went here before that on several occasions and many times my order was forgotten, after paying....and the staff is real unprofessional blasting music at nightclub volume at early breakfast and lunch times.  I'm a neighbor, but will never go here again!!!!|0
Unless you are a regular or look like your wallet is fat don't expect the best service.  Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection.   I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .    My meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.    Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.    Just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.    Two thumbs way down.|0
Bad customer service!    No one at the front desk for thirty minutes.  Plus they left the phone on the counter so when I tried to call their number, phone just kept ringing and ringing.  :(|0
Nice selection of stuff, but they have so little help available you will wait for darn near forever to get fabric cut, THEN wait in line forever to pay.  For such a giant store, it appears there are 3 employees.  That's it.  I miss Hancock Fabrics, THEY knew how to treat customers.|0
"Just because this place is called ""Maria Maria"" doesn't mean they sell Mexican food. Their menu actually says ""Mexican inspired cuisine"" which should have been my clue to leave. The food is border line Nasty!    The restaurant is cute and sort of romantic but it's so loud in there that it ruins the ""romantic"" mood. I was excited to see they had live music until they started playing some weird pop music. Why would they do that in a ""Mexican"" restaurant?  I wanted to leave but our waitress was no where to be found 20minutes after we finished our meal.  I don't recommend this place for any meal!    I have only been living in Scottsdale for two months but it seem that Arizona is ""Cougar"" town. The bar was full of them. I'm beyond annoyed with all this ladies acting like they are 21 wherever I go. I'm embarrassed for them. They dress and act young but with that face and hands who are they kidding besides themselves? gee."|0
YUUKK!!!  That pretty much describes this place.  We went there on Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Only 1 person in line in front of us.  I ordered the 2 meat combo, rib tips and hot links...sides of mac & cheese and potato salad.     ...it took about 40 mins to get my food.  But I told myself if it was good...then it's worth the wait.  But by God it wasn't good at all.  The mac & cheese had no flavor at all...i mean none.  The potato salad was very flavorless as well.  The rib tips would have been good if they weren't covered in 5 gallons of bbq sauce, nasty bbq sauce at that.  Their sauce is like a sweet and sour sauce...was not good at all.  The hot links were mixed in with the rib tips and covered in the same sauce.  So couldn't tell if they were any good, cause there was so much of that damn sauce.  The funny part was that the couple that ordered right after me, got their food and took it right back to the counter and straight out said that the food was just disgusting.  I wish I would have done the same instead of spending $15+ on nasty bbq.  In short.  I will not be going back here.|0
"So I had this important event to attend in California and I've already spent a lot of money preparing for my trip. Earlier in the month I had received a coupon for $40 off any service at Epic salon. Wow, that is a lot of savings and I could sure use to save some money. Epic uses  Goldwell products which is my product of choice. I just needed a tint touch-up (about 1"") so I went to this salon... I had already had an awesome experience at another salon in town, but I couldn't pass up the savings by using the $40 coupon)  I was second-guessing the idea of trying a new salon since I had already found one I absolutly loved. .Again though, the coupon lured me in. Anyway, I walked away with the worst experience ever. Not only was my color wrong ( I am a golden blonde and she colored my 1' outgrowth to a 3"" ash) when I went back in to explain what was so wrong with it (5min later), the front desk lady was rude and cut me off as I was speaking to her. Not the best way to handle a pissed of lady expecially about her hair! I gave them a chance to fix it and the only thing they did was put a gold glaze on my hair, which did not help at all.  The style sucked too. I just left. I did not have time to see if they could fix it again. I will not be going back to this place for any services. Noy only because the hair experience was bad, but because the front desk gal made a bad impession of the place even worse with her nastiness. UGH! I will give this place 1 star only because on the coupon was also a savings of 30% off products."|0
Cool place but don't try to arrange a special event. The proprietor was arragont, unflexible and unethical when I held my friend's bachelorette party at The Duce. Be warned!|0
OK. So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.  Boy, they are pretty sad.  I usually don't like to be too harsh on anyone, but this airlines deserves it.    Please, don't think of this review as complaining, but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right? Haha.).  Well, not never, but if you have no other choice.  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines, Nippon airlines, shoot, you can even throw Delta in there.  The flight attendants are rude. This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.    You know what, I could go on and on, but I really don't like to cry about stuff.  Would I fly US Airways again? No way.  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?  Maybe.  I just hope that their service of customers get better.    Then again, maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadn't shaved and looked Talibanish.  Oops.|0
I am writing this review only for the optical department. I accidentally poked my eye with a branch yesterday and knew I had damaged it so I went to the Gilbert Costco optician and asked if I could be seeing on an emergency basis. The receptionist asked me if I could come back in 5 hours to which I stated it was an emergency and could asked the Dr if she could see me. She asked her and she said no she did not have time. I find it very unbelievable that on an emergency basis they can turn someone away who has a Costco optics patient for years. I recognize that she had a patient at the time but I said I could wait until after so she could at least take 5 minutes to tell me if I should go to a hospital or not. Dont ever waste your time going here if you need immediate attention for an emergency because they will not make room for you.|0
Avoid at all costs. Awful service, slow as hell, only uses disposable plasticware/plates to add landfill insult to heinous food.  Despite telling them we were in a rush to catch a plane and multiple reassurances that the food would arrive in plenty of time, they lollygagged around and I ended up paying $30 to be seriously pissed off and hungry with no food.   BLECH.|0
"One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, ""hey wow, this is kinda cool"" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had ""cottage cheese"" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us ""you either pay or i come over the counter"" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here.    Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard, are crap.  All in all, if you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you.  If you're a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food, go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied."|0
"I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night. When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, ""not too long."" We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began.   Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours.   After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time.   I don't recommend going to Macayos. You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road."|0
Hot Breakfast..........NOT, Again cold food when it supposed to be hot....people beware of this over price place and lack of care for the customer it seems that this is the way of doing business.  *** Again a nice place to visit but DO NOT EAT HERE.*** And DO NOT CARE!|0
I never got a chance to try the food because I was so turned off by the way I was treated. My family and I will be waiting for a table across the parking lot at The Cheesecake Factory.|0
Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for, but this one is worth skipping. The service I've experienced each time I've been is pretty dang poor and the drinks always seem quite cold.|0
This is my very first review and I can't say I feel bad for what I am about to write. I took everyones review hoping for a really good hotdog and onion rings like the reviews I read (best hot dog ever, amazing hotdog., etc) oh man were we disappointed.  I'd have to say I'd go to cocstco for a hotdog for $1.50 with a drink.|0
They served us stale rice.  Average main dishes, not as flavorful.  Not enough meat in the lamb dishes.  Overpriced.|0
My sister recently took her '98 VW New Beetle to First Class Auto in Scottsdale, AZ for an overheating issue.  I'm normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but I was ~600 miles away.  She described the symptoms as follows: overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again.  I immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason.  Since I wasn't around to look at it, she took it to First Class Auto.  She relayed the symptoms to the guys at First Class and also SPECIFICALLY requested they check  radiator fan functionality.  They told her the water pump was cracked and leaking, needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there (water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine--2.0L 8V 4 cyl AEG code).  Well, a) I personally replaced the timing belt, water pump and serpentine belt about 10,000 miles ago as preventative maintenance.  What's more is the car hasn't lost any coolant since the job.  So the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely!  I did not replace the thermostat, though.  Once she called me to tell me this, I told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out.  I had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the Phoenix area so I decided I would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday.  FIRST thing I did was check the radiator fans.  I turned on the AC and the fans didn't come on at all.  I pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted 30 AMP fuse.  Guess what that fuse is for?  The RADIATOR FANS!  Imagine that.  Being a car that lived most of its life in Michigan, some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt.  The coolant level was exactly at the max level, right where it was after I did the maintenance on it 10,000 miles ago, not to mention I checked it before her recent trip to Scottsdale (didn't have to add anything.  The car doesn't leak a drop of coolant).  Local dealer had a new fuse panel in stock, I swapped it out and replaced all 3 of the 30 amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly.  The larger strip fuses were still decent.  The radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat.  The hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well, so that's definitely not a problem!  Fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits 99 deg Celsius like they're supposed to.  Problem solved!  I drove down to First Class Auto today to give them a chance to explain/defend themselves, but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didn't recognize and no one at the counter.  What great customer service!  So she COULD have spent the quoted $800 and STILL had the same problem!  She just got dinged for a ~$40 diagnostic fee... for an incorrect diagnosis.|0
When owners/staff changed we kept hoping for the best.  (The friendly owners/cooks of the previous restaurant were top notch, hence the good reviews).  But now, alas. . . Lemon chicken that turned out to be pork (and bad at that), wontons in soup that fall apart, greasy greasy lo mein and eggrolls, it's just not worth it.  Prefer to give locals the business, but this is truly awful, even after many hopeful tries.  Panda Express it is until someone else does a better job.|0
This place is pure crap! The players are sub-par and un-entertaining,  (especially Mike Clement and Julie Martinez).  , and the door men are ridiculously cheesy, and rude.  I'm a regular at piano bars all over the country when I'm traveling (Pete's Piano Bar in Austin, Howl At The Moon in Scottsdale) and The Big Bang in Tempe is a terrible destination. Save your tips and bar $ for the aforementioned places and take my word for it.|0
This place is disgusting!!  The bun was dry and stale.  The veggie burger was yucky... I don't think I have ever had one I didn't like before.  The kids meals are miniscule.  The topping bar is so simple and plain.  The dips are not very good... cheese dip is YUCK!  Drink choices stink.  Cookies taste raw and boring.  Almost forgot to add that the two young kids didn't even care for the french fries because they are seasoned.  I thought they were a total waste of calories.  I can't believe the prices either... so not cheap or even worth what you pay for.|0
I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and all the bones came complementary! SICK!  I almost broke my teeth when I bit into it.  The service was even worse, the manager (I think) stood in the way of me ordering while he was talking on the phone about football for about 10 min.GROSS!|0
4 stars for the place itself and it's food/coffee. 0 stars for the service, or lack there of.  My business partner and I were in town for a convention.  We heard we should check out Lola.  So we did.  We were excited.  The lady (I use the term loosely here) who took our order was LESS than patient OR helpful.  We asked a few questions.  She barely answered us, then when we had to repeat the question she was nothing short of annoyed.  An example.  We asked where we could get a glass or cup of water.  She mumbled something about the bar/table.  My partner walked over and saw no cups.  She came back and asked where the cups were.  On the table came an exasperated retort.  I walked over to inspect for myself.  There were no cups on the table.  So I kindly asked her if the cups should be on the table, if so there appeared to be none.  She said they are on the table, but *sigh* I'll go check, but I know they're there!  10 seconds later she comes out of the kitchen with a tube of cups.  IMAGINE THAT the customer was right.  I watched this lady serve other customers.  It appears that regulars are treated with a smile and courtesy and patience.  Newcomers or people she doesn't like are treated worse than the dirt on the bottom of her shoes.  My suggestion to management, adjust her attitude or get rid of her!  She is not good for business.|0
Hey Thai Elephant! Stop sucking! You used to be so good. Why is my egg roll cold? Why don't I get a fork with my food.... after asking!? Why won't you make me the Tiger on Fire for lunch when I got it last week for lunch?... AND it's on the menu! When did you decide to cut my curry portion in half almost? When did your service start sucking? Hey every person that decided that my two top was not important enough to attend! Why did it take 10 minutes to order my drink and then an additional ten minutes to actually get my drink? By the way, Tiger beer is on your menu. If you are not going to actually offer it, then you need to take it off your menu. I can't believe it's come to this... I used to love you. You broke my heart for the last time.|0
"Place is alright but for the waitress, poor service and things sent over we didn't order.  We sent them back but had  additional items brought and not brought on the tab anyway.  She said me ""that couldn't happen"" and refused to take it off. Waitress included autograt.   I have been here a dozen times and never get great service but enjoy myself.  This time will be my last."|0
Completely shady.  Towed our U-haul as we were moving in to our new Apartment Complex.  Completely unethical and total crooks.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!|0
I love Mexican food. Today I ate half of a taco and simply had to stop; not in a good way either. The meat tasted like it had been frozen multiple times and lacked flavor. The tortilla tasted like it was store bought and made of paper. The beans were flavorless. The rice was hard and lacked any flavor. Moving to the vegetables: shredded plastic is not actually a vegtable. This is some of the worst tasting, most over priced Mexican food I had had. It would be one thing if it was reasonably priced, but $10 for taco is a absurd amount for a worst than fast-food taste.   The margarita was good, but $10 for a margarita is a bit on the high side.  The service was average, but I found it odd that my waitress didn't find it odd that only a bite of each item was missing and never asked how the food tasted.|0
I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to, I would have rated no stars at all!.... I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here. The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES! I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me.....|0
Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote, one price, done deal. Buyer beware...|0
Their alcohol slushies are undrinkable and are sure case of gut rot. As far as the place, its pretty small you'll probably want to leave after 10 minutes.|0
I have only been going to LA Fitness for about 6 months. I live in Scottsdale and work in Phoenix, so I go to the 20th St & Camelback, Scottsdale and Oak and McCormick Ranch locations.  The Scottsdale locations are GREAT! They are clean, the staff is really nice and I see people cleaning the equipment when they are done.  What is it with the Camelback crowd?  The place really smells bad! It really needs a good cleaning. There has been this big spot on the carpet in front of the womens locker room since I started.  I was on the treadmill the other day really noticing how stinky it was and then the guy next to me finished up and just walked off, I swear he was sweating like a pig, left the equipment drenched! UGH!!!  Good God! I couldn't believe it, Can't the employees make these people clean after themselves?? The reviews are right about the staff just hanging around at the front desk.....they should be cleaning something, anything.  It really is a shame that this centrally located facility is a real stinky mess!!  I can't wait for the new one to open on 7th Avenue! Maybe then they may clean up their act.|0
"Bad shop, rude owners. Pro-tip: If you want to ""enhance"" the Phoenix community you could start by not playing music loudly when it's obvious that there are musicians trying to perform their sets that people paid to see at the well-respected venue next door."|0
"I'm sad to report that we dined here for lunch and it was inedible:(  Chef Aaron please come by and monitor your staff.  We had the eggplant sandwich and is was a disaster.  It was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate.  The shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality.  The beer menu looked fabulous.  So I guess if this is just a watering hole things will be fine...but if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied.  We hope this turns around.  The decor is cool and the staff is really fun and helpful...and we are hopeful for a great place to visit in the ""hood""."|0
Waste of time. I could not even get in there today because there was a football game. The wanted me to pay $10 just to park. How stupid is that! 2 days before Christmas. I noticed all the prices were the same and somtimes more than any other mall. Goobye and good riddens. I have better things to do with my time and money.|0
Soggy flavorless pizza served on unwarmed ceramic plate. Carbonara was watery and made with cream instead of eggs. Gnocchi was tough as opposed to light and airy.|0
"Do Not Eat Here if you think a bathroom in any way has anything to do with the cleanliness of the food preperation.  There was literally dried smeared feces on the toilet seat and the floor looked like it had never been washed.  Of course the restroom cleaning check-list was not initialed the entire day. Oh...I almost forgot there were no paper towels to dry my hands.  I told one of the employess and he says ""I know dude"".  It's rediculous that the bathroom looks like this when you have 10 employess standing around with their thumbs up their asses gossiping.   Burger was over-priced.  Milkshake was ok.  Also no napkins anywhere in sight on the tables or at the bar area.  Apparently napkins are something you have to ask for?  Whoever owns this place needs to get a better manager at this facility, because he is loosing money with all of the one-time customers who will choose to go somehwere else next time."|0
Went to Sol for restaurant week.  Was less than impressed with the bitter salad with MIA avocados, the carnitas that were very bland and boring, the rice was delicious, however the black beans tasted like aspirin, dessert was a dulche flan that was hard, solid and icky.  Service was average, took 2 hours to get thru dinner.  Best part was the refreshing wine and beer!  Cheers to SOL, we wont be returning.|0
Sadly with new owners comes changes on menu.  My fav Barbecue chicken salad no longer has a hint of the same taste. It should now be called flavor of tomato.   Also sad to find out that the most outstanding veggie sandwich now tastes like it comes from another country. Again not a single hint of similarity of same flavor. Im sure many people will love these new changes.  Yet, Im sad it's not the same. I woke up today dreaming about the old veggie sandwich! No joking!!!!!!!!!|0
"This was my second visit to Arriba's and believe me, it wasn't my choice. I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY, especially green chile. When you walk into Arriba's it's New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the state.  When we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesn't have pork in it she said, ""Well, we say that but it's not *really* New Mexican"" and walked off. What?!?!  The first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction. I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no. Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation, had these interactions been better this review wouldn't be here.  I'm far from being a vegetarian, I don't eat pork or beef because I don't like it. Also, I didn't ask about the red chile sauce because I'm not a fan, maybe it's porkless and amazing but I can't speak for that...  I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad.  Iceberg lettuce, slimy greens, cooked onions and bell peppers, mushy tomatoes, half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell... yuck.   If it wasn't for the delicious fresh chips, guacamole and two 99cent happy hour margaritas I would've been VERY unhappy.  I definitely won't ever be back and this time I mean it."|0
"My office moved to the area so I was driving around and saw the sign "" Best Sandwich...."" Um, no. If you want, I can come in there and show you how to cook a Chicken Cheese steak. First, don't wrap it up and let the sandwich sweat and make the bun soft and chewy. Second, put some meat on there. It was 50% bun.  It should be toasted and crunchy. And price, a 12"" chicken cheese chips and drink was $13..are you kidding me. For that price, I was hoping for the best I ever had. Change it up Capriottis or the word will get out and it will all be over in this very tough market."|0
"Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron. Honest.   So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before.   But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station.   I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. ""Wow,"" I thought, ""It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying.""   So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it.   Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days.   Only, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off.   Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.

I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts).  Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies.  This place deserves a thumbs-down, unless you love Americanized Asian.  The food was bland, breaded and just not worth any money.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I definitely won't eat here.|0
What ever you do don't waste your money here.  I am not the person who likes to send food back, in fact I hate to do it.  I had no choice here, this was by far the worst mexican food I have eaten.  The food has such a horrible after taste.  I not only hated my meal but tried my boyfriends as well and it was still terrible.  The service compares to the food, we waited forvever just for a server to come over and greet us.  I wouldn't even recommend this place to my enemies.|0
Very loud, crowded and quite unpleasant. I felt very cramped and the environment was very uncomfortable.|0
"Have been going to LGO since 2003 and have always enjoyed the cuisine. Several times - either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the Pizzeria - the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant. Last night the demographic in the Pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 30-80 years of age. Several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with ""it's just how we do things"" and ""there's no point in asking because they won't turn it down even a little"". The waiter, David, said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner ""really doesn't care"". Hubris is so unappetizing. I think the food is great but, because I have no desire to support a business that really doesn't give a crap about its clientele, I'll spend my money lavishly elsewhere."|0
Wow. Worst food poisoning of my life. Ate here Saturday night for my birthday. Started to just not feel right about 20 minutes afterward. Sunday I never left the bed except to go be sick. I lost a full FIVE pounds in one day. Stay away from the salmon. I for one will never go back. I'm really sad too because I decided on it from the reviews. Another reviewer said they were disappointed in the recent quality. I should have listened!!|0
"The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldn't remember what we ordered, kept having to ask, and still didn't get it right.  In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos, my husband finally said, ""ok, time out! I'm the customer.  Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues."". They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us, then they actually IGNORED us, finished their conversation, then finished our sandwiches.  We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!  Good thing I like avacado, because it ended up on my sandwich & I didn't order it, and after telling the girl, she said, ""I thought you said..."". Still had the order wrong!  Whew!"|0
Called last night @ 4:30 and tried to do call ahead seating for 6:30 for a party of 9. We are in town and are here to see some friends. Explained to hostess that some in the group are seniors so would need to have assurance on reservation. I was told to call back in an hour, the thought process by her was that it was too soon to give me a time and they weren't that busy yet. So I did as told and called back and after about 10 minutes of confusion and other waiting I was told we couldn't be seated until 7:30 or we could have seperate booths. I explained that we needed to sit together and 2 hours was the best she could do. I was so frustrated I told her no thanks that we would find other arrangements. She said ok and that was it. Nice job Texas Roadhouse. NOT!!! There is no excuse for not having a reservation system in place, like Open Table. One day there will be no customers to disappoint, then maybe you will get it.|0
If we hadn't arrived after a tiring day and prepaid online, I would have checked out.  Furniture missing.  Security bar sheared off.  Faceplates for wiring gone.  Furniture handles missing.  Bobby pins and scraps of things on carpet - hadn't been vacuumed.  Two remaining chairs badly stained.  You wouldn't want to sit on them.  No uniforms or name tags on staff.  Pick another chain.  The reviews for the other Ramada's in the area - which I read after the fact - reflect the same things.|0
I found Gaylee to be the most unprofessional nail tech.  I found her on an internet deal.  I called her on Sat and requested an apt on the following Friday.  She never returned my call till I reported her.  She denied my 5 messages and said she only got one msg which she couldn't return cause she lost her voice.  She conveniently had a voice after she was investigated.  I would never trust her to do my nails.  Yet reading the reviews she did return some calls.|0
ok so here's what they teach:  if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself, because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person.  Stealing is okay, lying is okay, as long as it is done by you, but for the others, they have no place in society, so pillage and destroy them, it is your right and you will be rewarded for that.  Wow.|0
"Warning: Douche Bag level CODE RED!  Here's how my experience went ...   Me: ""May I have a Carmel Latte?""  Employee: ""No"" .... dead air ... Me: ""Ummm why not?"" Employee: ""We don't have carmel"" Me: ""Ummm I guess I'll just have a Cappuccino then"" Employee: ""Just so you know it's a REAL Cappuccino"" Me: ""Okay"" (in my head I'm trying to figure out if I can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not).  So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he'll be moving to downtown Phoenix soon. To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho. What a complete and utter douche bag. Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!).  This experience was months ago, and now they have opened up a shop downtown. Guess what? I'm not going to check them out. Fuck you Cartel. You'll never be Lux, so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you haven't earned.  Complete FAIL.   For my two cents, skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail. Authentically cool with ZERO attitude, great coffee and no douche bag employees.   And as for great coffee ... try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool.  ----  please read ""owners comment"" below ... here's my response ...  ---- Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... I guess my new job  should be to ""promote good coffee in Arizona"" ... and I don't appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee ...   By that definition I guess I don't know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if it's not acoustic or a good voice unless it's A cappella ... thanks for proving my point. I wouldn't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... (I guess) they don't need your business you poser!"|0
